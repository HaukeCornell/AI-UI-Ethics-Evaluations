# CHI 2025 Submission Integration Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. New Title and Abstract
- **Title**: "Deceptive User Experience Metrics: How Ethics-Focused Evaluation Frameworks Lower Designer Willingness to Release Dark Patterns"
- **Abstract**: Updated to 149 words, incorporating the three-condition experiment with 141 UX professionals
- Includes key finding: 30% → 56% rejection rate progression across conditions

### 2. Updated Overleaf Paper Structure

#### Abstract (`00_abstract.tex`)
- ✅ Replaced with new 149-word abstract
- ✅ Focuses on three-condition experiment findings
- ✅ Highlights practical significance (near-doubling of rejection rates)

#### Title (`main_acm_CHI_tempalte.tex`)
- ✅ Updated to new provocative but accurate title
- ✅ Maintains focus on "deceptive metrics" and "release dark patterns"

#### Methods (`03_method.tex`)
- ✅ Completely replaced with three-condition experimental design
- ✅ 141 participants (75.2% with decision authority)
- ✅ Three conditions: No Evaluation, UEQ, UEQ+Autonomy
- ✅ Professional sample validation (93.6% familiar with dark patterns)

#### Results (`04_results.tex`)
- ✅ New results section with strong statistical findings
- ✅ Large effect sizes (d=0.56-1.20)
- ✅ 6 interfaces showing significant autonomy effects after FDR correction
- ✅ Clear progression: No Eval > UEQ > UEQ+Autonomy for acceptance

### 3. Graphics Integration
- ✅ Copied main visualization plots to graphics folder:
  - `overall_tendency_comparison.png`
  - `overall_rejection_comparison.png` 
  - `three_condition_tendency_comparison.png`
  - `demographics_complete_summary.png`

## Key Strengths of New Paper

### Methodological Rigor
- **Professional sample**: 75.2% have design decision authority
- **Ecological validity**: Real evaluation data from 120 social media users
- **Robust statistics**: FDR correction, large effect sizes, proper power

### Theoretical Contribution
- **Novel finding**: Evaluation frameworks actively shape ethical judgment
- **Practical impact**: 26.2 percentage point difference in rejection rates
- **Mechanism identified**: Autonomy-focused evaluation increases ethical sensitivity

### Clear Story Arc
1. **Problem**: Standard UX metrics may bias toward accepting harmful design
2. **Method**: Three-condition experiment with professional designers
3. **Finding**: Evaluation lens fundamentally shapes ethical design decisions
4. **Implication**: Need for autonomy-focused evaluation frameworks

## Next Steps for Full Submission

### Integration Needed
1. **Introduction**: Frame around evaluation bias problem
2. **Literature Review**: Merge original UEEQ work with decision-making literature
3. **Discussion**: Implications for UX practice and future research
4. **Figures**: Add key visualizations to results section

### Strengths to Highlight
- **Practical relevance**: Direct applicability to design practice
- **Strong effects**: Near-doubling of ethical sensitivity
- **Professional validity**: Sample has real decision-making authority
- **Theoretical advance**: From "metrics don't capture" to "metrics actively bias"

## Word Count Status
- **Abstract**: 149/150 words ✅
- **Title**: Optimized for impact and accuracy ✅
- **Core content**: Ready for CHI submission format ✅

The paper now tells a much stronger, more focused story about how evaluation frameworks shape ethical design decisions, with compelling empirical evidence and clear practical implications.
