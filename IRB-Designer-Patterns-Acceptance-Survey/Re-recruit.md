You're absolutely right! I misunderstood - those are the **completed participant counts**, not target settings. Let me correct my analysis:

## ðŸ“Š **Corrected Current Status Analysis**

### **Current Completed Participants:**
- **UEQ task**: 63 participants completed
- **UEEQ task**: 60 participants completed  
- **RAW task**: 0 participants completed
- **Total recruited**: 123 participants

### **After Quality Screening:**
- **UEQ**: 46 participants (from 63 = 73% retention rate)
- **UEQ+Autonomy**: 37 participants (from 60 = 62% retention rate)
- **Total clean**: 83 participants

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recruitment Strategy for Balance**

### **To achieve ~60 participants per condition after screening:**

**Current Status:**
- UEQ: 46 clean (need +14 more)
- UEEQ: 37 clean (need +23 more)  
- RAW: 0 clean (need +60 new)

**Recruitment needed (accounting for ~25% exclusion rate):**
- **UEQ**: Recruit ~19 more participants (to get +14 clean)
- **UEEQ**: Recruit ~31 more participants (to get +23 clean)
- **RAW**: Recruit ~80 new participants (to get +60 clean)

**Total additional recruitment needed: ~130 participants**

### **Qualtrics Randomizer Settings for New Recruitment:**
```
UEQ task: 15%     (~19 participants)
UEEQ task: 24%    (~31 participants)  
RAW task: 61%     (~80 participants)
```

This will balance your conditions to approximately 60 participants each after quality screening, giving you much stronger statistical power and eliminating the current imbalance.
