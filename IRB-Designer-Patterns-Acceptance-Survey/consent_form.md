## Understanding How User Experience Data Influences Design Evaluation: A Survey Study

### What is this study about?

We are interested in understanding how different types of user experience evaluation data influence professional designers' assessment and recommendation processes. You will be shown interface designs along with user evaluation data and asked to make recommendations about whether these designs should be implemented.

### What will you be asked to do?

If you agree to participate, you will:
- Complete a brief questionnaire about your professional background (3 minutes)
- Review 10-15 interface designs with accompanying user evaluation data (20-25 minutes)
- For each design, indicate whether you would recommend its implementation and explain your reasoning
- Answer questions about your decision-making process (5 minutes)

**Total time commitment: Approximately 30-35 minutes**

### Risks and discomforts

There are minimal risks associated with this study. You may experience mild discomfort when reviewing certain interface designs, as some examples may demonstrate controversial or unfamiliar design approaches. You are free to skip any questions that make you uncomfortable.

### Benefits

There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this research. However, your participation may help advance understanding of design evaluation practices and contribute to the development of better design assessment tools.

### Compensation

You will receive compensation for your time and participation in this study. The compensation amount ($8-10) was agreed upon before you entered the survey and will be provided upon successful completion of the study. Payment will be made through the recruitment platform (if recruited via Prolific) or via digital gift card (if recruited through other channels) within one week of study completion.

### Confidentiality

Your responses will be kept completely confidential. We will not collect any personally identifying information that could link your responses back to you. All data will be stored securely on encrypted Cornell University systems and will only be accessible to the research team.

### Voluntary participation

Your participation in this research is entirely voluntary. You have the right to:
- Decline to participate without any consequences
- Skip any questions you prefer not to answer
- Withdraw from the study at any time 

### Use of AI-generated content
