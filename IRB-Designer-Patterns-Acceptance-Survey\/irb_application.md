**IRB Protocol Title**: The Impact of User Experience Metrics on Designers' Ethical Decision-Making: A Survey Study

**Lay Summary**: 
This study investigates how different user experience evaluation metrics influence professional designers' willingness to implement potentially manipulative interface designs. Participants will view interface mockups alongside user evaluation data presented in different formats (standard UX metrics vs. ethics-enhanced metrics) and indicate whether they would recommend implementing these designs. The goal is to understand whether enhanced UX metrics that capture ethical concerns can influence designers' decision-making toward more ethical design choices.

**Is this a student project?**: Yes

**Type of project**: PhD student research

**Please describe**: PhD student research spun out from a class project, supervised by Prof. Helen Nissenbaum, building on prior published work on dark patterns and UX metrics.

## Protocol Description

### Purpose and goals of the research

The purpose of this research is to examine how different user experience (UX) evaluation metrics influence professional designers' ethical decision-making when evaluating interface designs. The study aims to determine whether presenting UX evaluation data with enhanced ethical considerations (manipulation, deception, addiction potential) affects designers' willingness to implement potentially problematic interface designs compared to standard UX metrics alone.

### How will this study contribute to existing knowledge?

This study will contribute to existing knowledge by providing empirical evidence on whether enhanced UX metrics can serve as a practical intervention for promoting ethical design decisions in professional contexts. It builds on prior research demonstrating that standard UX metrics fail to capture manipulative design elements, and tests whether alternative metric presentations can influence real-world design decision-making. The findings will inform the development of ethical design evaluation tools and practices.

### Will the research involve secondary use of data, documents, records or biospecimens collected from individuals?

No

### Describe what participants will be asked to do and/or what information or specimens will be collected from them.

Participants in this study will be asked to evaluate interface designs and make recommendations about their implementation. The study will be conducted online through a survey platform. Participants will:

1. Complete a brief demographic questionnaire about their design experience and role
2. View a series of interface mockups (approximately 10-15 interfaces)
3. For each interface, view user evaluation data presented either as:
   - Condition A: Standard UX metrics (efficiency, satisfaction, usability)
   - Condition B: Enhanced metrics including ethical considerations (manipulation, deception, addiction potential)
4. Answer the primary question: "If you had the power to decide, would you release this interface design?" (Yes/No)
5. Provide brief explanations for their decisions in open-text fields
6. Complete follow-up questions about their decision-making process

The interfaces shown will include examples from prior research on dark patterns, along with both ethical and potentially manipulative design examples. User evaluation data will be drawn from previously collected studies and may include AI-generated examples clearly labeled as such.

### Provide a sequential list of all study components, including any follow-up sessions. List the estimated time needed for each component, as well as the total time commitment for participants.

1. **Informed consent and eligibility screening** (2 minutes)
2. **Demographic and professional background questionnaire** (3 minutes)
3. **Interface evaluation task** (20-25 minutes)
   - Review 10-15 interface designs with accompanying user data
   - Make implementation decisions and provide reasoning
4. **Post-study questionnaire about decision-making process** (5 minutes)
5. **Debrief and study completion** (2 minutes)

**Total estimated time**: 30-35 minutes

### Will the research team input participant data into an AI tool or rely on software that makes use of AI features?

Potentially yes - some of the interface examples or user evaluation data shown to participants may be generated using AI tools, but this will be clearly disclosed to participants. No participant data will be input into AI tools during the study.

### Will this study involve participants directly interacting with an AI tool or service?

No

### Describe any other websites, software, or electronic resources that will be used for data collection.

The study will be conducted using Qualtrics survey platform (https://cornell.yul1.qualtrics.com). Interface mockups will be hosted on a secure platform (likely Framer.com or similar) and embedded in the survey. Participants will be recruited through professional networks and possibly Prolific for supplemental recruitment.

### Anticipated start date of the research**: [To be determined based on IRB approval]

### Describe the sampling plan and the sample size.

We plan to recruit 100-150 professional designers and design decision-makers. Participants will be stratified by role (individual contributors vs. decision-makers) and experience level. We will use convenience sampling through professional networks, design communities, and potentially Prolific for additional recruitment.
