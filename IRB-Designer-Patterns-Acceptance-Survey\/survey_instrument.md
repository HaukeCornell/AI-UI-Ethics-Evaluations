## Section 3: Interface Evaluation Task (20-25 minutes)

### Instructions
*"You will now see a series of interface designs along with user evaluation data. For each interface, please review the design and the user feedback data, then answer the questions below. Imagine you are in a position to make or influence the decision about whether to implement this design."*

### For Each Interface (10-15 interfaces total):

#### Interface Presentation
- Display interface mockup
- Show evaluation data in assigned condition:
  - **Condition A (Standard UX Metrics)**: Gauges showing efficiency, satisfaction, ease of use, clarity
  - **Condition B (Enhanced Ethics Metrics)**: Same metrics PLUS manipulation, deception, addiction potential, pressuring behavior

#### Primary Decision Question
- **"If you had the power to decide, would you release this interface design?"**
- Options: Yes / No

#### Reasoning (Required)
- **"Please explain your decision:"**
- Open text field (500 character limit)

#### Confidence Rating
- **"How confident are you in this decision?"**
- Scale: 1 (Not at all confident) to 7 (Extremely confident)

#### Additional Factors (Optional)
- **"What other factors would you want to consider before making this decision?"**
- Open text field (300 character limit)

### Interface Types Include:
1. **Dark Pattern Examples** (from literature):
   - Manipulative subscription flows
   - Deceptive privacy settings
   - Forced social sharing
   - Misleading button labels

2. **Neutral/Positive Examples**:
   - Standard e-commerce checkout
   - Clear navigation designs
   - Transparent privacy controls

3. **Ambiguous Cases**:
   - Gamification elements
   - Social proof indicators
   - Personalization features

- Options: User satisfaction / Ease of use / Business impact / Ethical considerations / Legal compliance / User safety / Innovation / Other (specify)

### Evaluation Data Usage
- **"How much did the user evaluation data influence your decisions?"**
- Scale: 1 (Not at all) to 7 (Extremely influential)

### Professional Practice
- **"In your professional work, how often do you encounter designs that you consider ethically questionable?"**
- Options: Never / Rarely / Sometimes / Often / Very often

### Organizational Support
- **"How supportive is your organization of rejecting designs based on ethical concerns?"**
- Scale: 1 (Not at all supportive) to 7 (Extremely supportive) + "Not applicable"

### Metric Preferences
- **"What additional information would be most helpful when evaluating interface designs?"**
- Multiple select: Long-term user behavior data / Accessibility metrics / Privacy impact assessments / Psychological impact measures / Regulatory compliance scores / Other (specify)

### Open Feedback
- **"Any additional thoughts about the interface evaluation process or this study?"**
- Open text field (optional, 500 character limit)

## Section 5: Debrief and Completion (2 minutes)

### Study Purpose Revelation
*"Thank you for your participation! This study examined whether presenting user experience data with enhanced ethical metrics (manipulation, deception, addiction potential) influences designers' willingness to implement potentially problematic interfaces compared to standard UX metrics alone."*

### Final Questions

#### Awareness Check
- **"Did you notice differences in how the user evaluation data was presented across different interfaces?"**
- Options: Yes / No / Unsure

#### Study Feedback
- **"Do you have any feedback about this study or questions about the research?"**
