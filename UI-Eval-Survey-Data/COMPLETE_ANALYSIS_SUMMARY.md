## LaTeX Methods Section

**Participants.** We recruited N = 83 participants through Prolific Academic, all with professional experience in UI/UX design, product design, or design decision-making roles. The majority had substantial professional experience: 48.2% with 3-5 years and 44.6% with 1-2 years of design experience, indicating a sample with relevant domain expertise for interface evaluation.

**Professional Context and Expertise.** Importantly, 63 participants (75.9%) reported having decision-making authority in their current roles (final decision authority or significant influence), ensuring our sample included individuals who actively engage in design decision-making processes. Additionally, 76 participants (91.6%) regularly encounter ethically questionable designs in their professional work (sometimes, often, or very often), supporting the ecological validity of our findings. Participants were primarily UX/UI Designers (50.6%) working across diverse company sizes, with 41.0% in startups or small companies and 59.0% in medium to large organizations, representing typical industry contexts where design decisions are made.
