# CONFIDENCE ANALYSIS: METHODS, RESULTS, AND DISCUSSION SECTIONS

## METHODS SECTION ADDITION

### Decision Confidence Measurement
Alongside each release tendency decision, participants rated their confidence in their decision on a 0-7 scale (0 = "Completely uncertain", 7 = "Completely certain"). This allowed us to examine whether providing additional UX evaluation data influenced not only the decisions themselves but also participants' confidence in their judgments. Confidence data were analyzed using the same mixed effects modeling approach as the tendency data, accounting for participant and interface random effects.

## RESULTS SECTION ADDITION

### Decision Confidence Across Evaluation Conditions
We analyzed participants' confidence ratings across the three evaluation conditions using mixed effects modeling (N = 1,520 individual evaluations). Contrary to expectations that additional evaluation information would increase confidence, we found no significant differences between conditions (χ²(2) = 4.26, p = 0.119).

Mean confidence ratings were:
- UI condition: 5.80 ± 0.16
- UEQ condition: 5.35 ± 0.15  
- UEQ-A condition: 5.55 ± 0.15

All post-hoc comparisons were non-significant (UI vs UEQ: p = 0.105; UI vs UEQ-A: p = 0.494; UEQ vs UEQ-A: p = 0.601). Notably, confidence was consistently high across all conditions (median = 6 for all conditions), indicating that participants felt confident in their decisions regardless of the amount of evaluation information provided.

## DISCUSSION SECTION: DESIGNER OVERCONFIDENCE INSIGHTS

### The Paradox of Designer Overconfidence
Our confidence findings reveal a striking pattern of **designer overconfidence** that has important implications for UX evaluation practice. Despite the clear behavioral differences in release decisions across conditions—with participants being significantly more conservative when provided with UEQ metrics (tendency: UI=4.66 vs UEQ=3.80, p<0.01) and even more so with autonomy risk information (UEQ-A=3.14, p<0.001)—participants maintained consistently high confidence in their judgments regardless of the information available to them.

#### Overconfidence in Rational Decision-Making
This pattern suggests that **designers systematically overestimate their rational decision-making capabilities**. When presented with UI screenshots alone, participants were highly confident (M=5.80) in decisions that were demonstrably different from those they would make with more comprehensive information. This confidence did not decrease when additional UEQ metrics revealed potential usability issues, nor when autonomy risk assessments highlighted ethical concerns that further changed their decisions.

#### Implications for UX Practice
The overconfidence effect has several critical implications:

1. **False Sense of Certainty**: Designers may believe they can make sound release decisions based on limited information, potentially leading to premature product releases or inadequate evaluation processes.

2. **Resistance to Additional Evaluation**: High confidence in initial assessments may create resistance to conducting more comprehensive UX evaluations, as designers may feel their initial judgments are sufficient.

3. **Bias Blindness**: The consistency of high confidence across conditions suggests designers may be unaware of how additional information systematically influences their decisions, representing a form of bias blindness.

#### Theoretical Connections
This finding aligns with the **Dunning-Kruger effect** in UX contexts, where overconfidence is particularly pronounced when expertise is limited or when operating with incomplete information. It also connects to research on **confirmation bias** in design decisions, where initial impressions become anchored and additional information is processed to confirm rather than challenge existing judgments.

#### Recommendations for UX Evaluation
To mitigate overconfidence effects, we recommend:
- **Structured evaluation protocols** that require consideration of multiple evaluation dimensions before making release decisions
- **Devil's advocate processes** that explicitly challenge initial confidence assessments  
- **Confidence calibration training** to help designers better align their subjective confidence with objective decision accuracy
- **Multi-perspective evaluation teams** to reduce individual overconfidence effects

#### Future Research Directions
Future research should explore whether overconfidence patterns persist with:
- Expert vs. novice UX practitioners
- Different types of interface categories (e.g., safety-critical systems)
- Explicit uncertainty training interventions
- Team-based vs. individual decision contexts

The disconnect between decision changes and confidence stability represents a fundamental challenge for evidence-based UX practice and highlights the need for systematic approaches to combat designer overconfidence in evaluation contexts.
