# Next Steps & Recommendations for Study Enhancement

## Current Status Summary
✅ **Strong significant results found**: Both hypotheses supported with medium-to-large effect sizes  
✅ **Adequate sample sizes**: n=83 total (UEQ: 46, UEQ+Autonomy: 37)  
✅ **Robust data quality**: 13 suspicious participants excluded after systematic screening  
✅ **Statistical assumptions met**: Normal distributions, equal variances  

## Recommendation 1: Sample Size & Power Enhancement

### Should you recruit more participants?
**RECOMMENDATION: YES, but strategically**

#### Rationale:
- Current study is already **statistically significant** with medium-large effects
- Unequal group sizes (46 vs 37) - ideally should be balanced
- Increasing power will provide more precise effect size estimates
- Enables detection of smaller, practically meaningful effects

#### Suggested approach:
- **Target**: n=60 per condition (120 total) for balanced design
- **Recruitment**: Additional 34 participants for UEQ+Autonomy, 14 for UEQ
- **Power**: This would provide >90% power to detect d=0.5 effects
- **Benefits**: More precise confidence intervals, stronger evidence for publication

### Quality vs Quantity:
Prioritize **quality participants** over raw numbers:
- Use stricter Prolific screening (higher approval rates, UX design experience)
- Include attention checks within the survey
- Consider small monetary bonus for thorough explanations

## Recommendation 2: Expert Sample Enhancement

### Should you recruit trusted experts?
**RECOMMENDATION: YES, as a separate validation study**

#### Current sample characteristics:
- Prolific participants with "UX design experience" (self-reported)
- Variable expertise levels (evident from response quality)
- Some responses suggest limited familiarity with UX evaluation frameworks

#### Expert recruitment strategy:
- **Target**: n=30-40 genuine UX professionals (LinkedIn, professional networks)
- **Criteria**: 3+ years UX design experience, formal HCI/design education
- **Validation approach**: Compare expert vs general designer responses
- **Value added**: 
  - Higher face validity
  - Professional credibility for findings
  - Potential for qualitative insights about evaluation framework preferences

## Recommendation 3: Baseline Condition (No UX Metrics)

### Is it worth adding a "no metrics" condition?
**RECOMMENDATION: CONDITIONAL - Consider hybrid approach**

#### Pros of adding baseline:
- ✅ Shows incremental value of any UX evaluation vs pure visual judgment
- ✅ Stronger causal claims about metric influence
- ✅ Three-way comparison: No metrics < UEQ < UEQ+Autonomy

#### Cons of separate recruitment:
- ❌ Different sample, non-random assignment breaks experimental design
- ❌ Temporal confounds (participants recruited at different times)
- ❌ Sample composition effects (different participant pools)

#### **HYBRID RECOMMENDATION**:
1. **Within current study**: Add retrospective "gut feeling" ratings
   - Ask participants: "How would you have decided without seeing the metrics?"
   - Provides within-subject baseline comparison

2. **Future study**: Include no-metrics condition in new randomized design
   - If recruiting more participants anyway, add third condition
   - Recruit all conditions simultaneously for proper randomization

## Recommendation 4: Study Design Enhancements

### Immediate improvements for additional recruitment:
1. **Enhanced screening questions**:
   - "How many years of UX design experience do you have?"
   - "Which UX evaluation methods are you familiar with?" (attention check)
   - "Describe a recent design decision you made based on user research"

2. **Improved data quality measures**:
   - Attention checks embedded in survey
   - Minimum response time requirements
   - Character count requirements for explanations

3. **Additional dependent variables**:
   - Confidence in release decisions
   - Perceived importance of different metric types
   - Open-ended feedback about evaluation frameworks

### Timing considerations:
- **Current momentum**: Significant results provide strong foundation
- **Incremental value**: Additional data strengthens rather than changes conclusions
- **Publication timeline**: Consider whether enhanced sample delays publication

## Recommendation 5: Priority Order

### **HIGH PRIORITY (Do first):**
1. ✅ Self-verify results in JAMOVI/JASP using provided checklist
2. ✅ Balance sample sizes (recruit ~25 more UEQ+Autonomy participants)
3. ✅ Implement enhanced screening for new recruits

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY (If time allows):**
4. 🔄 Expert validation study (separate, smaller sample)
5. 🔄 Add retrospective "no metrics" question to current participants

### **LOW PRIORITY (Future work):**
6. 🔜 Full three-condition study with no-metrics baseline (separate paper)
7. 🔜 Longitudinal study tracking actual design decisions

## Final Recommendation

**PROCEED WITH**: Balanced sample enhancement (target n=60 per condition) using improved screening, while simultaneously recruiting expert validation sample. This provides both statistical power and professional credibility without delaying core findings.

The current results are **publication-ready** - enhancements would strengthen rather than change conclusions.
