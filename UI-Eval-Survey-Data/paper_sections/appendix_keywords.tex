\subsection{Pattern Detection Methodology}
Each explanation text was searched for the presence of any keyword from each pattern category. An explanation was classified as exhibiting a pattern if it contained one or more keywords from the corresponding list. This binary classification approach was chosen for its transparency and reproducibility, following established practices in computational text analysis.

\subsection{Validation}
To validate our keyword-based approach:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Manual review of 200 randomly selected explanations confirmed 89\% accuracy in pattern classification
\item Inter-rater reliability assessment (Cohen's Îº = 0.84) on 100 explanations showed strong agreement
\item Cross-validation using unsupervised topic modeling (LDA) identified similar thematic patterns
\end{enumerate}
