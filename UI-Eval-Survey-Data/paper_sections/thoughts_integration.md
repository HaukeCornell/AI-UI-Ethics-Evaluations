- There is a tendency of "let the data speak" but the data is an artifact of what questions are asked. 
- The UI collected in the tacxonomy are instances of real world interface patterns, that emerge due to many social contextual factors.
- It may be that the dark patterns that emerge and stabilize are there also due to questions asked in the default standardized user testing processes, they do not appear to have extremely negative evaluations on UX.
- Evaluation frameworks matter more than ever, with increase of automated evaluations for designs, automated design improvements through AB tests, and AI alignment through human feedback. 
- When Dark Patterns term was coined, a reliance on business metrics was already dicussed as a problem, yet verly little research has been done on how UX metrics influence design decisions, and to our knowldedge, none on how they influence ethical design decisions.
- The first work to experimentally demonstrate that evaluation frameworks actively shape ethical judgment rather than merely failing to capture ethics. This bridges theory and practice with strong empirical evidence (N=141, large effect sizes d=0.56-1.20).
- **UX evaluation frameworks are not neutral, they are design interventions themselves, and can be used to nudge designers towards more ethical decisions.**
1. Current UX evaluation methods are powerful but ethics-blind
2. Professional practice research shows UX practitioners face ethical tensions
3. Measurement shapes behavior (Goodhart's Law in design practice)
4. Your experimental evidence proves frameworks influence ethical decisions
5. Integration needed rather than separate ethical assessment tools
