- There is a tendency of "let the data speak" but the data is an artifact of what questions are asked. 
- The UI collected in the tacxonomy are instances of real world interface patterns, that emerge due to many social contextual factors.
- It may be that the dark patterns that emerge and stabilize are there also due to questions asked in the default standardized user testing processes, they do not appear to have extremely negative evaluations on UX.
- Evaluation frameworks matter more than ever, with increase of automated evaluations for designs, automated design improvements through AB tests, and AI alignment through human feedback. 
- When Dark Patterns term was coined, a reliance on business metrics was already dicussed as a problem, yet verly little research has been done on how UX metrics influence design decisions, and to our knowldedge, none on how they influence ethical design decisions.
- The first work to experimentally demonstrate that evaluation frameworks actively shape ethical judgment rather than merely failing to capture ethics. This bridges theory and practice with strong empirical evidence (N=141, large effect sizes d=0.56-1.20).
- **UX evaluation frameworks are not neutral, they are design interventions themselves, and can be used to nudge designers towards more ethical decisions.**
1. Current UX evaluation methods are powerful but ethics-blind
2. Professional practice research shows UX practitioners face ethical tensions
3. Measurement shapes behavior (Goodhart's Law in design practice)
4. Your experimental evidence proves frameworks influence ethical decisions
5. Integration needed rather than separate ethical assessment tools


**Discussion with advisor Notes

Build the Argument:

1 Designers are receptive /****triggered** **to ethics frameworks sensibility --Seems done.

2 Do designers want this? Irrespectively of what companies see as goals, design communities have shown interest in design ethics (VAP value sensitive design, etc.) Need to show evidence in own literature review section. Restructure** --Seems done.

DP is a particular design trend, UX communities have classified as elements in interface (interactive) design that undermine ethical values SUCH as user autonomyy, privacy, security harm --Seems done.

DP are a class of design elements that are counter-indications of ethical design --Seems done.

Main finding of this work is that the UX metrics

THEY make things salient,
and ethically focused metrics can

TRIGGER

ethical sensibility. --Seems done.

**Introduction**

TAKES TO LONG TO GET INTO IT --Seems done.

Directly:
1\. DIVE INTO THE METRICS (most companies today rely on metrics, they are therfore very important) --Seems done.

They are effective, useful etc. --Seems done.

2\. Design community over a few decades has started showing interest in ethical aspects of interactive design, which we've seen in various literature (there are people who are interested in ethics), Dark Pattern community brings to attention that --Seems done.

As much as designers might be commited What we are showing is that unless you explicitly include some metrics, for ethical commitment, **these tend not to be salient. Unless we take these metrics seriously,** --Seems NOT done.

3\. Metrics make a difference, but make them explicit. --Seems partially done.
Bulleted Discussion points: Responsibility --Seems done.

Values in design should be own section --Seems done.

Proffessional Tools for being more ethical aware designer (much interest), games cards etc. exist --Seems done.

Discussion (parts of it trickl up into intro) --Seems not fully done.

However our insighsts show Commitment through metrics, value commitment, dicusscio section, in big scheme of things, they migjht feel a duty if the company is complex and uses these metrics dutyfully. -**\> triggers ethical sensibility in the designers in the moment of evaluation --Seems partially done.

**Our recommendation for achieving ethical design is that including methods like this should be done, however we recognize that for the most part there could be other currents that might make the inclusion of metrics such as these difficult - SOmetoimes people think they are not necessary, they think general ethical sensinility is sufficient, sometimes making such consaiderations salient could run contraty to company interest which is what we acknowldge. Our work is condition in that sense. --Seems not? fully done.

Metrics vs guidelines --Seems partially done.
How these metrics are generated, through user testing, experts can learn how to generate metrics to abstract insights. 
Measurement of user responses to particular design features,
Different from designers say USE HELVETICA font because in studies they said users found HELVETICA most beautiful
Translate into direct guideliens. Metrics unlike guidelines carry some empircial weight. --Seems NOT done.

Future work -
Some people might argue that, this particular approach to revealign metrics in this style format not god instead teach ethical sensibility directl, we agree with lorenz sanchez not everyone can HAVE ethical foresight, expertise etc.  --Seems not done yet.
Some critiques might say this appraoch Its not replacing expertise this approach might. --Seems not done yet. 

Why now (needs to be in intro and Related work)? > FUTURE PROOFING ETHICAL DESIGN
Companies will start/have utilizing computational and AI methods to create UI, metrics are a key guide for automating we want to trigger ethical consideration in computational design --Seems done.
Metrics are already in use, and will likely be come even more important when some aspect of interatiojn desing will be automated. --Seems partially done, focus on itneraction design not just visual design.

lastly
SPRUCE UP, sleeken streamline the literatue review. --Seems not fully done.
introduction needs to be sharpened to get the argument right up front -seems mostly done

We need a new title --Seems done.
