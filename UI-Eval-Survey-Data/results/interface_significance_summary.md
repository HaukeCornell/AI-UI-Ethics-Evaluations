# Key Findings from Interface-Level Analysis with Statistical Testing

## SIGNIFICANT INTERFACES IDENTIFIED:

### Interfaces with Significant Differences (p < 0.05):

**Interface 2 (UI2):**
- Significant tendency difference (p = 0.023, d = -0.835)
- UEQ+Autonomy shows LOWER tendency scores than UEQ
- Large effect size (d > 0.8)

**Interface 8 (UI8):**
- Significant rejection difference (p = 0.022, d = 0.756) 
- Significant tendency difference (p = 0.015, d = -0.777)
- UEQ+Autonomy shows HIGHER rejection rates and LOWER tendency scores
- Large effect sizes in both measures

**Interface 11 (UI11):**
- Significant tendency difference (p = 0.038, d = -0.683)
- UEQ+Autonomy shows LOWER tendency scores than UEQ
- Medium-to-large effect size

**Interface 15 (UI15):**
- Significant rejection difference (p = 0.011, d = 0.857)
- Significant tendency difference (p = 0.043, d = -0.629) 
- UEQ+Autonomy shows HIGHER rejection rates and LOWER tendency scores
- Large effect sizes in both measures

## SUMMARY STATISTICS:

- **Total interfaces analyzed:** 15 (all with sufficient data n â‰¥ 8)
- **Interfaces with significant rejection differences:** 2 (UI8, UI15)
- **Interfaces with significant tendency differences:** 4 (UI2, UI8, UI11, UI15)
- **Overall pattern:** UEQ+Autonomy tends to result in more critical evaluations

## OVERALL INTERFACE-LEVEL EFFECTS:

- **Mean rejection difference:** +3.36% (UEQ+Autonomy slightly higher)
- **Mean tendency difference:** -0.39 points (UEQ+Autonomy slightly lower)

## INTERPRETATION:

While the participant-level analysis showed NO significant overall effects, 
the interface-level analysis reveals that certain specific interfaces DO show 
significant differences between UEQ and UEQ+Autonomy evaluation frameworks.

**Pattern:** When significant differences occur, UEQ+Autonomy consistently leads to:
- HIGHER rejection rates
- LOWER release tendency scores  
- More critical/conservative evaluation decisions

This suggests that ethics-enhanced evaluation (UEQ+Autonomy) makes evaluators 
more sensitive to problematic design patterns in specific interfaces, even though 
this effect doesn't reach significance when averaged across all interfaces and participants.

## RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS:

1. **Interface-Specific Effects:** UEQ+Autonomy impacts are not uniform across all interfaces
2. **Effect Heterogeneity:** Some interfaces are more sensitive to ethics-enhanced evaluation
3. **Conservative Bias:** When effects occur, they favor more conservative/critical decisions
4. **Measurement Sensitivity:** Interface-level analysis can detect effects missed in aggregate analysis
