# Multiple Comparisons Correction Analysis Summary

## üéØ **CRITICAL FINDING: NO EFFECTS SURVIVE MULTIPLE COMPARISONS CORRECTION**

### **The Reality Check:**
When we correctly account for testing **15 interfaces √ó 2 measures = 30 statistical tests**, the "significant" effects disappear.

## üìä **CORRECTION RESULTS**

### **UNCORRECTED (Œ± = 0.05):**
- **Rejection differences**: 2 of 15 (Hindering Account Deletion, Social Pressure)
- **Tendency differences**: 4 of 15 (Content Custom, Hindering Account Deletion, Pull to Refresh, Social Pressure)

### **FDR CORRECTED (Benjamini-Hochberg, Œ± = 0.05):**
- **Rejection differences**: **0 of 15** ‚ùå
- **Tendency differences**: **0 of 15** ‚ùå

### **BONFERRONI CORRECTED (Œ± = 0.05):**
- **Rejection differences**: **0 of 15** ‚ùå
- **Tendency differences**: **0 of 15** ‚ùå

## üîç **WHAT THIS MEANS**

### **Multiple Testing Problem:**
- With 15 interfaces tested, we expect **0.75 false positives** by chance alone (15 √ó 0.05)
- We found **2 "significant" rejection effects** and **4 "significant" tendency effects
- This is consistent with **Type I error inflation** from multiple testing

### **Closest to Significance (FDR-corrected p-values):**
1. **Social Pressure** rejection: FDR p = 0.162 (close, but not significant)
2. **Content Customization** tendency: FDR p = 0.161 (close, but not significant)
3. **Hindering Account Deletion** tendency: FDR p = 0.161 (close, but not significant)
4. **Pull to Refresh** tendency: FDR p = 0.161 (close, but not significant)
5. **Social Pressure** tendency: FDR p = 0.161 (close, but not significant)

## üìà **UPDATED CHARTS WITH PROPER CORRECTIONS**

### **New Files:**
- `plots/dark_patterns_rejection_corrected_significance.png` - Shows FDR-corrected p-values, **no *** symbols**
- `plots/dark_patterns_tendency_corrected_significance.png` - Shows FDR-corrected p-values, **no *** symbols**
- `results/dark_patterns_multiple_comparisons_corrected.csv` - Complete correction details

### **Visual Indicators:**
- **Red titles**: Would indicate FDR-significant effects (none found)
- **Black titles**: Non-significant after correction (all patterns)
- **No *** or significance lines**: No effects survive correction

## üéØ **SCIENTIFIC INTERPRETATION**

### **What We Actually Found:**
1. **NO significant differences** between UEQ and UEQ+Autonomy after proper statistical correction
2. **Some suggestive trends** (FDR p ‚âà 0.16) but not statistically reliable
3. **Pattern consistent with chance findings** from multiple testing

### **Why This Matters:**
- **Original "significant" findings** were likely **false positives**
- **Proper statistical rigor** reveals no robust effects
- **UEQ+Autonomy does not significantly differ** from standard UEQ evaluation

## üìö **STATISTICAL BEST PRACTICES APPLIED**

### **Multiple Comparisons Corrections Used:**
1. **Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR)**: Controls false discovery rate, more powerful than Bonferroni
2. **Bonferroni**: Controls family-wise error rate, most conservative
3. **Both show same result**: No significant effects

### **Why Correction is Essential:**
- **15 interfaces tested** = high multiple testing burden
- **Œ± = 0.05 per test** without correction = **58% chance of at least one false positive**
- **Proper correction** maintains overall Type I error rate at 5%

## üîÑ **REVISED CONCLUSIONS**

### **Original Claim (Uncorrected):**
"UEQ+Autonomy makes evaluators more sensitive to specific problematic dark patterns"

### **Corrected Conclusion:**
"After accounting for multiple comparisons, **no significant differences** were found between UEQ and UEQ+Autonomy evaluation frameworks at the interface level"

### **Research Implications:**
1. **Interface-level effects** are not robust when properly tested
2. **Participant-level null findings** are consistent with corrected interface analysis
3. **UEQ+Autonomy implementation** may need substantial enhancement to show reliable effects
4. **Future studies** should be adequately powered and pre-specify correction methods

This correction demonstrates the **critical importance of proper statistical methodology** in interface evaluation research.
