Understanding How User Experience Data Influences Design Evaluation: A Survey Study

What is this study about?

We are interested in understanding how different types of user experience evaluation data influence professional designers' assessment and recommendation processes. You will be shown interface designs along with user evaluation data and asked to make recommendations about whether these designs should be implemented.

What will you be asked to do?

If you agree to participate, you will:


	Complete a brief questionnaire about your professional background (3 minutes)
	Review 10 interface designs with accompanying user evaluation data (15-20 minutes)
	For each design, indicate whether you would recommend its implementation and explain your reasoning
	Note: If you do not see any user experience data, you've been assigned to the baseline condition where we want to see designers release tendencies of interfaces without evaluation data
Answer questions about your decision-making process (5 minutes)


Total time commitment: Approximately 25 minutes

Risks and discomforts

There are minimal risks associated with this study. You may experience mild discomfort when reviewing certain interface designs, as some examples may demonstrate controversial or unfamiliar design approaches. You are free to skip any questions that make you uncomfortable.

Benefits

There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this research. However, your participation may help advance understanding of design evaluation practices and contribute to the development of better design assessment tools. You will receive compensation for your time as listed in the recruitment materials. You may also receive an additional $2 reward for providing high-quality, comprehensive responses.

Confidentiality

Your responses will be kept completely confidential. We will not collect any personally identifying information that could link your responses back to you. All data will be stored securely on encrypted Cornell University systems and will only be accessible to the research team.

These weaknesses could frustrate users and reduce engagement, which is risky for a social media platform trying to grow.

While attractiveness and stimulation are slightly negative, they don’t outweigh the overall positive composite score of 0.33.

Key usability concerns include poor organization (Cluttered vs. Organized at -1.20) and lack of clarity (Confusing vs. Clear at -1.12), which suggest users may struggle to navigate or understand the interface. Emotional engagement is also weak, with low friendliness (-0.88) and enjoyment (-0.57), meaning the design is unlikely to feel inviting or satisfying. These problems could reduce adoption rates, increase drop-offs, and harm retention critical risks in a competitive startup environment, so improvements should be made before release.	6					4	Yes	The overall UX score is slightly positive (0.23), with strong marks in clarity and ease of use.

While dependability and trust-related scores are slightly negative, they are mild compared to the strong positives in perspicuity and efficiency, which are critical for first-time user adoption. "	6					1	No	The user experience results show multiple serious usability and trust concerns. While there are small positives in organization (0.38), ease of use (0.44), and addictiveness (0.86), these are outweighed by significant negatives in clarity (-0.76), predictability (-0.46), and especially supportiveness (-1.17). Engagement metrics such as stimulation (-0.86, -0.76) indicate the interface fails to capture interest, while attractiveness is strongly negative (-1.97, -2.13), suggesting users find it unpleasant and unfriendly.	7	1	No	"The user testing data shows strongly negative scores across almost all UX metrics, with the composite UX quality at -0.85 and the overall mean at -0.9. Participants rated it as inefficient, unclear, unsupportive, and even unfriendly, with particularly poor attractiveness (-1.69, -1.44) and dependability (-0.95, -1.23) scores. "	4	3	No	While the design scores positively in core usability—efficiency (0.34), clarity (0.61), and ease of use (1.06)—there are significant negatives in areas that affect long-term user retention and trust. Notably, the coercion score is extremely poor (-1.83), suggesting users feel pressured, which can quickly erode goodwill and cause churn. Attractiveness (-0.73, -0.87) and stimulation (-0.23, -0.63) are also negative, indicating the interface risks being perceived as unappealing and unengaging.	6	5	Yes	The interface shows solid strengths in core usability—efficiency (0.43, 0.40), clarity (0.53), and predictability (0.70)—meaning users should be able to navigate it with minimal confusion. While emotional appeal scores like attractiveness (-0.44, -0.47) and stimulation (-0.15, 0.03) are slightly negative, they are mild and unlikely to cause major adoption issues in the short term. Trust-related scores (deception -0.76) are somewhat concerning, but not critically low, and can be addressed in follow-up iterations. Given the positive composite UX score (0.18), strong business backing, and the market need for quick deployment, the design is suitable for release, with plans to enhance friendliness and excitement later.	6	1	No	This interface has severe negative ratings across key UX areas. Efficiency (-0.71, -0.71) and clarity (-0.23) are weak, while supportiveness is extremely low (-2.08), indicating a frustrating and obstructive experience. Engagement metrics are highly negative, with stimulation (-1.26, -1.79) and attractiveness (-1.97, -1.73) suggesting users find it both unappealing and uninteresting.	7					4	Yes	This interface performs very well in the core usability metrics: high efficiency (0.97, 0.75), strong clarity and ease of use (1.66, 0.59), and supportive interaction (1.07). Emotional engagement scores are also positive overall, with friendliness (0.80) and enjoyability (0.34) being above average. The trust metrics are reassuring, with no major red flags for deception (0.07) and a strong transparency score (1.11).	7	5	Yes	This interface shows generally strong usability and clarity metrics: efficiency (0.57, 0.90) and perspicuity (0.97, 0.44) indicate that users can navigate and understand the interface without difficulty. Dependability is mostly neutral to positive (0.03, 0.36), suggesting the interface behaves as expected.	7	0	No	While there are moderate positives in organization (0.69) and ease of use (0.53), the design suffers from severe negatives in user trust and emotional appeal. Supportiveness (-1.85), attractiveness (-2.15 for both measures), coercion (-1.93), and deception (-1.97) indicate a high likelihood of alienating users. Engagement scores are low, with stimulation (0.00, -0.83) showing little excitement or interest generation. The overall UX quality (-0.42) and mean score (-0.7) suggest the design would deliver a below-average user experience, which could harm retention in a competitive market.	5																																																																					AI evaluation data	AI evaluation data	3	5	4	5	Yes, but rarely	Sometimes	User satisfaction,Innovation,User safety	1					3	2				Somewaht familiar	Long-term user behavior data,Accessibility metrics,Psychological impact measures,Combined AI-human evaluation		no	Product Designer		Technology/Software,Gaming,Media/Entertainment		Medium (200-1000)	Some input	Prolific		no	67e1c8a328f6249cc066d025	67e1c8a328f6249cc066d025

The design's efficiency, attractiveness, and stimulation scores are neutral or negative, which could impact user engagement. More critically, the coercion and deception scores suggest potential issues with pressuring or deceptive design elements, which could harm user trust and ultimately, the product's reputation. Given the competitive market and limited runway, I believe it's crucial to prioritize a strong user experience and transparency. I'd request further refinement to address these concerns before releasing Interface 2	6	6	Yes	I would release Interface 3 because its overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.51) is positive, indicating a good user experience. The design's strengths in efficiency, perspicuity, and stimulation outweigh its weaknesses. Although areas like dependability and attractiveness need improvement, I believe the design's benefits make it worthy of release with refinements	6					2	No	I wouldn't release Interface 5 because the UX evaluation data indicates significant issues with user experience, particularly in areas like Attractiveness (-1.97 and -2.13), Coercion (-2.11), and Deception (-2.09). These scores suggest that the design may be annoying, pressuring, and potentially manipulative, which could harm users and damage the company's reputation. Given these concerns, I would require substantial redesign and testing to address these issues before considering release. The negative Overall UX Quality Composite Score (-0.56) further supports the need for significant improvements	7																	0	No	I wouldn't release Interface 10 due to its poor user experience scores, which could lead to user frustration and low engagement. The design's issues with efficiency, perspicuity, and attractiveness outweigh its potential business benefits. Revising the design to address these issues is essential before considering release	6	7	Yes	I would release Interface 11 because its UX evaluation scores indicate a strong user experience. The design excels in efficiency, perspicuity, dependability, and attractiveness, with a high Overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.85). While stimulation scores are moderate, the design doesn't appear to be pressuring or addictive. Given its strengths and positive user experience metrics, I believe Interface 11 is ready for release	7	0	No	I wouldn't release Interface 12 due to the significant concerns with Coercion (-1.13) and Deception (-0.89) scores. These scores suggest that the design may be pressuring or manipulative, potentially harming or exploiting users. As a UX Design Lead, my priority is to ensure a safe and respectful user experience. Given the potential risks, I would require substantial revisions to address these issues before considering release. The negative scores in Attractiveness also indicate potential issues, but the Coercion and Deception concerns take precedence. User well-being and safety outweigh business considerations in this case	7	0	No	I wouldn't release Interface 13 because the UX evaluation scores reveal significant issues that could harm the user experience and ultimately, the product's reputation. The strongly negative scores in attractiveness, coercion, deception, and dependability indicate that users may find the interface unpleasant, manipulative, and untrustworthy. Given the competitive market and limited runway, prioritizing a positive user experience is crucial to attract and retain users. Releasing Interface 13 in its current state would likely lead to user dissatisfaction and potential long-term consequences for the product. A thorough redesign is necessary to address these issues and ensure a better user experience	7	0	No	I wouldn't release Interface 14 because the UX evaluation data indicates significant issues with user experience, including negative scores for Perspicuity, Dependability, Attractiveness, and Coercion. The Deception score (-1.76) is particularly concerning, suggesting potential user manipulation. Given these findings, releasing the design could harm users and damage the company's reputation. I'd require substantial redesign and re-evaluation to address these issues before considering release. The negative Overall UX Quality Composite Score (-0.6) further supports the need for significant improvements	7	5	Yes	I would release Interface 15 because, despite some areas for improvement, the design demonstrates strengths in perspicuity, efficiency, and dependability. The Overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.29) is positive, indicating a generally good user experience. While the design could benefit from refinement to address issues with stimulation, attractiveness, and coercion, these concerns don't outweigh the design's overall potential.

Perspicuity is strong (0.98 and 1.30), meaning the interface is mostly clear and easy to understand.

Dependability I (0.71) indicates predictability is good.

High Disguise (1.49) and Addictiveness (1.26) scores, while not standard UX metrics, suggest that the design is engaging and transparent in certain aspects.


Weaknesses:

Attractiveness is a concern: “Annoying vs. Enjoyable” (-0.87) and “Unfriendly vs. Friendly” (-0.65) indicate users find it less pleasant to use, which could hurt adoption and satisfaction.

Stimulation is lukewarm (-0.09 and 0.28), so the experience may not feel exciting or engaging to many.

Dependability II (-0.11) shows some users perceive it as slightly obstructive.

Deception (-0.56) might hint at trust concerns — users may perceive intentions as less benevolent.


Overall View:

The Composite UX score (0.45) is mildly positive, showing the fundamentals are in place.

Problems are mostly emotional engagement and friendliness rather than functionality or clarity.

With these scores, an iterative launch could be sensible: release to a limited audience or as a phased rollout, gather real-world feedback, and address the attractiveness/friendliness issues early."	5	0	No	While the Overall UX Quality score is 0.23 (slightly positive) and certain metrics — notably Perspicuity I (1.09) and Perspicuity II (0.58) — indicate that users generally find the interface easy to understand and clear, there are several significant concerns that suggest the design isn’t ready for full release. The interface shows strong clarity and predictability, but low efficiency, low engagement, and trust/autonomy concerns mean it needs further refinement before release. Addressing the negative ethical perception (coercion & deception), reorganizing the layout for efficiency, and adding engaging design elements could raise both the composite UX score and user confidence.	5	4	Yes	"The overall UX quality score (0.51) suggests a moderately positive experience, with strong performance in Perspicuity (ease and clarity of use) and Efficiency I (perceived task efficiency). Users generally find the interface easy to understand and relatively efficient to work with, which is critical for adoption.

However, there are several risk areas that need to be addressed before or immediately after release:

1. Dependability – Scores for “Unpredictable vs. Predictable” (-0.50) and “Obstructive vs. Supportive” (-0.20) indicate the system may behave inconsistently or hinder user progress in certain scenarios, which could erode trust.


2. Ethics & Trust Perception – “Deceptive vs. Benevolent” (-0.82) is a red flag for perceived transparency and integrity. If users feel misled, adoption and satisfaction will drop.


3. Addictiveness – The very negative score (-1.47) suggests users feel the system is too attention-grabbing or possibly distracting, which may conflict with productivity goals.


4. Moderate Attractiveness – While not a major weakness, low enjoyment (+0.05) and friendliness (-0.10) could reduce long-term engagement."	5	3	No	"Key Concerns from the Scores

Efficiency & Clarity:

Efficiency I (-0.34) and Efficiency II (-1.19) indicate that users find the interface both inefficient and cluttered — a strong signal that navigation and task completion will be frustrating.

Perspicuity I (-0.59) and Perspicuity II (-1.29) mean users are finding the system both complicated and confusing, making onboarding and general usage harder.


User Friendliness & Trust:

Attractiveness I (-1.00) and Attractiveness II (-1.36) show the design is perceived as unpleasant and unfriendly — not a good recipe for adoption.

Deception (-1.28) is especially concerning — this suggests users feel the design may mislead them or is not transparent, which can damage brand trust.


Dependability & Support:

Dependability II (-0.72) means users feel the interface is obstructive instead of supportive.


Overall UX Quality:

Composite score of -0.56 signals that the design is below neutral across multiple UX dimensions, not just in one isolated area.




---

Release Tendency Justification

Even if some scores like Addictiveness (+0.88) and Disguise (+0.06) are neutral-to-positive, these don’t outweigh the fact that the design is viewed as unclear, unfriendly, and possibly deceptive. Launching in this state risks:

User frustration → drop-off in adoption

Reputational damage due to trust issues

Higher support costs from confusion and inefficiency



---

Recommendation

Do not release yet.

Prioritize reworking navigation, layout clarity, and visual friendliness.

Address transparency and communication to improve trustworthiness.

Re-test after adjustments to confirm improvement in Efficiency, Perspicuity, and Attractiveness before launch"	5	0	No	"Strong negative scores in key emotional and trust factors:

Attractiveness I & II (−1.97, −2.13) suggest users find it annoying and unfriendly — this is a major red flag for adoption.

Dependability I & II (−0.46, −1.17) indicate unpredictability and lack of support, undermining user trust.

Deception (−2.09) is especially concerning, as perceived dishonesty can completely alienate users.


Low stimulation and engagement:

Stimulation I & II (−0.86, −0.76) show users are finding the experience boring or uninteresting, which can lead to disengagement and abandonment.


Mixed efficiency and clarity:

Some positives (Efficiency II = +0.38) suggest the layout is somewhat organized.

But negatives in Perspicuity II (−0.76) indicate users find it confusing overall.


Overall UX Quality score is negative (−0.56) — meaning that, on average, the experience leans toward unsatisfactory. The Overall Mean including autonomy measures is even worse (−0.81).

Composite indicators suggest low release readiness:
This interface would likely frustrate users, damage trust, and reduce engagement — especially given the perception of coercion (−2.11) and lack of friendliness."	6	1	No	"1. Overall UX Quality is Negative

The Composite Score (-0.85) and Overall Mean (-0.9) are well below neutral, indicating that most user perceptions are unfavorable.

Multiple categories fall near or beyond -1.0, which in UX terms signals strong dissatisfaction.



2. Critical Weaknesses in Core Usability Areas

Efficiency (-0.82, -0.15) → Users perceive it as inefficient and somewhat cluttered, which directly impacts productivity.

Perspicuity (-0.79, -0.90) → The interface is seen as complicated and unclear, meaning learning curves and error rates will be high.

Dependability (-0.95, -1.23) → Being perceived as unpredictable and obstructive is a red flag for trust and reliability.



3. Emotional & Engagement Factors Are Poor

Attractiveness (-1.69, -1.44) and Stimulation (-0.58, -0.75) scores suggest the design frustrates users instead of engaging them.

Coercion (-1.59) and Deception (-1.53) imply users feel manipulated or misled, which can damage brand reputation and retention.



4. Business Risk

Launching with these ratings could lead to low adoption, high churn, increased support costs, and negative public perception.


"	5					3	Yes	"1. Strengths

Efficiency (0.43, 0.40) and Perspicuity (0.43, 0.53) are moderately positive, suggesting that users generally find the interface easy to use and reasonably well organized.

Dependability I (0.70) is the highest score, meaning users felt the interface behaved predictably.

Disguise (0.56) indicates transparency in certain aspects, which supports trust.



2. Weaknesses

Attractiveness scores are negative (-0.44, -0.47), showing that emotional appeal and friendliness are lacking—this could hurt user adoption even if the interface is functional.

Stimulation scores are near neutral or negative, which suggests users don’t find it engaging.

Dependability II (-0.22) shows some users felt the system was not supportive enough.

Deception (-0.76) is a serious red flag—it indicates a perception of misleading behavior, which could damage trust.



3. Overall Scores

UX composite: 0.18 → Slightly above neutral, meaning the experience is acceptable but far from exceptional.

Overall mean (including autonomy metrics): 0.02 → Basically neutral, showing the autonomy-related perceptions are pulling the overall rating down.



4. Business Risk

The functional foundation is solid enough to release, but the emotional, trust, and engagement elements need improvement to avoid user dissatisfaction over time.

If released as-is, the interface might work well for short-term transactional tasks but could underperform in retention, brand trust, or long-term satisfaction."	5	1	No	"Key Problem Areas

Efficiency (-0.71 & -0.71) – Users find it somewhat inefficient and cluttered, which can slow down task completion.

Dependability II (-2.08) – This is a major red flag. Users feel the system is obstructive rather than supportive, which erodes trust.

Stimulation & Attractiveness (scores between -1.26 and -1.97) – The interface is perceived as boring, uninteresting, unfriendly, and even annoying. This will hurt long-term engagement.

Coercion (-2.26) – Users feel pressured rather than guided, which can cause strong resistance or even ethical concerns.

Deception (-1.58) – Perceived dishonesty is a serious trust issue, and it will be hard to recover from if released as-is.


Some Positives

Perspicuity I (0.41) – It’s at least somewhat easy to understand.

Addictiveness (0.89) and Disguise (0.78) – Users don’t find it overtly intrusive in a negative way.

Dependability I (0.16) – Mildly predictable, so consistency is not completely broken.


Release Risk Assessment

With an Overall UX Quality of -0.94, the majority of critical metrics are in the negative range, especially those tied to trust, emotional engagement, and perceived autonomy.
Even if the business case is strong, releasing now could:

Damage brand reputation

Reduce adoption and retention

Increase support costs

Make later redesigns more difficult due to negative user impressions"	5					6	Yes	"Strengths (scores above +0.5)

Efficiency: Both Inefficient vs. Efficient (+0.97) and Cluttered vs. Organized (+0.75) indicate users find it fast and well-structured.

Perspicuity: Complicated vs. Easy (+1.66) is very high—users understand it quickly.

Dependability II (+1.07) shows the system feels supportive.

Friendliness (+0.80) and Disguise (+1.11) are strong—suggesting it’s approachable and transparent in presentation.

Overall UX quality at +0.85 means the core experience is solidly positive.


Weak spots (scores below 0)

Dependability I (-0.28) suggests some unpredictability—users may occasionally feel unsure about system responses.

Addictiveness (-1.00) indicates the interface is not habit-forming, which might be fine depending on business goals, but could mean low engagement over time.

Coercion (-0.04) is almost neutral but slightly on the “pressuring” side—worth monitoring for tone.


Neutral to mild positives

Exciting vs. Boring (+0.17) and Interesting vs. Not Interesting (+0.63) are okay but leave room for more engaging elements if desired."	6					1	No	"Critical weaknesses in emotional appeal — The Attractiveness scores are highly negative (-2.15 in both friendliness and enjoyability), which is a serious red flag. Even if the interface is functional, users are likely to dislike interacting with it.

Dependability issues — The ""Obstructive vs. Supportive"" measure is extremely low (-1.85), indicating the system actively hinders rather than helps. That’s a core usability failure.

Trust and ethical perception problems — The low scores in Coercion (-1.93) and Deception (-1.97) suggest users may feel manipulated or misled, which damages credibility and long-term adoption.

Mixed efficiency and clarity — While Efficiency II (organization) is strong at 0.69, Perspicuity II is negative (-0.40), meaning users still find the interface somewhat confusing.

Overall UX Quality is negative (-0.42), and the Overall Mean across all metrics is -0.7, signaling that dissatisfaction outweighs satisfaction.

The visibility setting being in orange to contrast from the black text the rest is written in is a nice touch as it allows the user to see the settings at a quick glance without having to dig to deep.	7									2	No	I would choose against releasing this design as it just doesn't flow well and presents the user with an almost overwhelming amount of information in big blocks of text. A simplified summary would be a nice addition at the beginning after clicking the icon on the first page shown.	5	2	No	Other than the splash of colour the Sign Up button adds to the screen it is overall bland and lifeless as a design. And not very enticing to the user visually.	4	4	Yes	I would release this design as some functions just need designs like this in order to be able to allow the user to select what they need/want to select. I just don't see many other options for how to design this sort of UI differently.	5	4	Yes	I would be likely to release this design as it isn't to dissimilar to other UI's used by social media etc. apps already. It is simple but visually appealing with the layout and graphics used.	6					2	No	I would not choose to release this design as it is intrusive and invades the users screen. This sort of message/notification would be much better suited to a discrete tab that shows at the top of the screen, much the same way text messages do on most mobile phones these days.	6	1	No	I would choose not to release this design as the UI is overall just too cluttered. Separating the options into drop down menus would have been a better choice for such a UI rather than the currently displayed design.	6	5	Yes	I would release this design as it is similar to the designs a lot of social media platforms use already and would fit in nicely with the overall aesthetic without being drastically different in terms of UI by comparison to other apps. Much like how Meta tends to keep a UI theme between all of their different apps.	5	5	Yes	I would release this design as the design is overall simple but visually appealing. It doesn't have too much going on and shows the information shown in a concise and simple to read fashion for the user allowing them to make an informed decision before selecting anything.	6									3	No	I would not release this design as it is too bland and doesn't really provide much information in the notification showing on screen.	4																																																																																																																									Both were equally useful	Human evaluation data	5	4	4	6	Yes, frequently	Sometimes	Ease of use,User satisfaction,Innovation	2	1					3				Somewaht familiar	Long-term user behavior data,Accessibility metrics,Combined AI-human evaluation		I believe that in the coming years the use of AI will supercede human evaluation in most cases as it will free up human workers to focus on other aspects of interface design, such as bug fixing or improving the aesthetics of the design.

Of which, it being addictive is good for daily active and return users, thus also good for business.	6	2	Yes	It is not very user friendly and too serious for social media, but based on its context of explaining in detail why everything might be happening on the app, the serious tone and design is fitting. Maybe diagrams and pictures/graphs might help make sure the users read the whole thing	6									1	No	The users don't seem to react positively with the functionality and overall ability to satisfy the user of the system. They also deemed the design untrustworthy by negative point on coercion, disguise, and deception.	5	6	Yes	There's just no easier and friendlier way to explain terms of an action. Maybe a nice neutral color box might make a difference.	7	4	Yes	THe idea is sound, but it limits the user's freedom of choice by giving them options to handle or customize their notifications.	7					7	Yes	Users love the design, and it being addictive is good for daily active and return users.	7	4	Yes	Users seem to react well on the functionality and usability of the design.

While the results show that the interface is clear and well organized, the strongly negative scores for attractiveness and low ratings for stimulation indicate that users found it unfriendly, unappealing, and not engaging. Since these qualities are critical for a social media product, releasing this design in its current state could create a poor first impression and limit user adoption.	6	5	Yes	I would approve this interface for release as its usability strengths (clear, predictable) outweigh its minor engagement flaws (slightly boring andunfriendly), but would prioritize post-launch improvements to boost stimulation and appeal. The neutral-to-positive overall score 0.23 justifies shipping now while iterating.	5					1	No	The business, marketing, and supervisor have approved the interface, the UX evaluation data shows significant negative scores in organization, clarity, friendliness, and overall enjoyment. Users found the interface confusing, cluttered, and unfriendly, which could harm engagement and retention. Releasing it in this state is risky, so it should be improved before launch. Instead, I would addressl UX issues (clarity, organization, and friendliness) before launch..	7	1	No	Due to serious UX issues, I would not release this interface. In particular, its low stimulation -0.86/-0.76, poor reliability -0.46/-1.17, and extremely negative attractiveness ratings -1.97/-2.13 suggest that users would find it uninteresting, unpredictable, and unpleasant.  The continuously subpar assessment data indicates that this design runs the danger of alienating consumers, which is lethal for a company with a short runway, even though business and leadership had already approved it.  Prioritising the resolution of these problems before to launch will help the team prevent engagement and retention from suffering.  Given the obvious UX red signals, I am quite confident in my choice.	6	2	No	This interface's serious usability (-0.90 clarity, -1.23 support) and user appeal (-1.69 pleasure) flaws will irritate and turn off users, endangering the viability of our firm.	4	0	No	Its low stimulation -0.23/-0.63 and attractiveness -0.73/-0.87 ratings suggest that consumers would find it uninteresting and unengaging, which is a serious shortcoming for a social media site.  Concerns around customer displeasure are also raised by the reliability support score of -0.55.  The dangers to user retention exceed the advantages, particularly for a business that requires strong engagement, even though the total score (0.1) is somewhat favourable.  Before launching, I would advise iterating on the interface and visual appeal.	7					1	No	The interface scores catastrophically low in engagement (-1.79 stimulation) and usability (-2.08 dependability support), making it actively hostile to users despite business approvals. Confidence 7/7 and hese scores predict user abandonment, which no startup can afford.	5	2	No	The gauge shows that the design sits below zero, closer to the red and orange zones, which represent poor user experience. This means users rated the interface as below average overall, finding it less clear, less enjoyable, and less usable compared to a neutral or positive design and also The overall UX quality is negative 0.57, which confirms that users had a bad experience. Since a social media product depends heavily on clarity, friendliness, and enjoyment to attract and keep users, releasing this version would be too risky and could harm adoption.	7					3	No	Although the business, marketing, and supervisor teams have approved this interface, the user evaluation data highlights clear weaknesses that make it risky to release. The design scores positively in efficiency and perspicuity, meaning it is generally easy to use and well organized. However, it performs poorly in attractiveness (–0.73 and –0.71) and stimulation (–0.18 and –0.22), showing that users found it unfriendly, unenjoyable, and not engaging. With an overall UX quality score of only 0.33, the design does not meet the experience standards required for a social media platform, where enjoyment and friendliness are critical for attracting and retaining users.	7									4	Yes	According to the statistics, this interface is well-structured, easy to use, and clear. It also has excellent efficiency ratings (0.41 and 0.72) and extremely high perspicuity values (1.72 and 1.16).  Additionally, users judged it to be quite predictable (0.61), indicating a solid basis for usability.  With visual improvements and engagement features, these problems can be resolved over time, even when the attractiveness and stimulation scores are on the lower end of the spectrum.	4																																																																																																																									Human evaluation data	Human evaluation data	5	4	6	5	Yes, but rarely	Sometimes	Ease of use,Business impact,User satisfaction	3	1	2								Somewaht familiar	Combined AI-human evaluation		While AI can enhance and expedite UX analysis, human testing remains irreplaceable for capturing authentic user experiences—particularly for subjective aspects like enjoyment, clarity, and emotional appeal.

"	7	0	No	The interface design scores extremely poorly on most UX metrics, including Efficiency, Perspicuity, Dependability, Attractiveness, and Deception. These issues could lead to a severely poor user experience, negatively impacting user engagement and retention. The negative scores are substantial, indicating a strong likelihood of user frustration and dissatisfaction.	7	2	No	"The interface design scores negatively on several key UX metrics, including Attractiveness (-0.73 and -0.87), Coercion (-1.83), Addictiveness (-0.88), and Deception (-0.83).

While the design scores well on Perspicuity (1.06 and 0.61), the overall negative scores and low Overall Mean (-0.25) indicate that significant revisions are needed before release.
"	6	5	Yes	The interface design scores relatively well on Efficiency (0.43 and 0.40), Perspicuity (0.43 and 0.53), and Dependability I (0.70), indicating that it is efficient and relatively easy to use. However, it scores negatively on Attractiveness (-0.44 and -0.47), Coercion (-0.46), and Deception (-0.76), which are concerning.

These negative scores suggest that the design is inefficient, obstructive, boring, annoying, pressuring, and deceptive, which could lead to a severely poor user experience.

The Overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.33) is positive, but the Overall Mean (0.0) suggests that the design is neutral overall. Given the mixed results, I'd want to revisit and refine certain aspects before releasing the design.
"	4					1	No	My decision is based on the negative scores on most UX metrics, which suggest that the interface design may be confusing, unattractive, and potentially deceptive. These issues could lead to a poor user experience, negatively impacting user engagement and retention. Given the competitive market and limited runway, it's crucial to prioritize user experience and ensure that the interface design meets high standards.	7	5	Yes	The interface design scores well on Efficiency (0.41 and 0.72) and Perspicuity (1.72 and 1.16), indicating that it is efficient and easy to use. However, it scores negatively on several other metrics, including Attractiveness (-0.67 and -0.60), Coercion (-1.02), and Addictiveness (-0.28). While these negative scores are concerning, the Overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.29) and Overall Mean (0.03) suggest that the design has some redeeming qualities. Given the business approval and potential benefits, I would release the design but consider further refinement to address the negative scores.	5																																																													Human evaluation data	Human evaluation data	5	4	7	4	Yes, occasionally	Often												Very familiar	Long-term user behavior data		While AI evaluation data can be useful, human evaluation provides essential context and nuance.

Its release assists in the development of users and user interaction and avoids costly delays.

Concluding approval helps harmonize across teams and increase the probability of success of the startup."	7	6	Yes	" As the business, marketing and supervisor teams are already ratified and the developers have started the integration, it is advisable to release the design so that the other departments align. The restraint at this stage may cost it resources and growth in a very competitive market. The release approval facilitates user interaction, monetization and the necessity of the company to capture future financing."	7	7	Yes	" The design has already been approved by all key stakeholders such as the business, marketing and the supervisors and developers are busy in integrating it which is a pointer of organization-wide alignment. As the interface will foster user interaction and financial gains, the launch thereof will contribute towards the development of the startup within a competitive environment. By postponing release, the momentum might be put at risk hence proceeding is the optimal decision."	7	7	Yes	" The interface can be released because business, marketing and leadership have already approved, and developers have started the integration which does not mean any extra delays and wastage of resources. The layout is in accordance with growth priorities, and it provides a high possibility to attract and keep the users in the competitive market. The monitoring of risks can be done after the launch, however, refusing approval at this point would harm the momentum and chances of financing."	7					7	Yes	" The interface is the most strategic option since the business, marketing and supervisor have already agreed on this and the developers have started doing the integration. Its approval will facilitate quicker growth, enable the company to remain competitive in a competitive market, and will be in line with the company dire need to win and retain users. Any postponement to release may result in a stalled momentum and funding opportunities will be lost."	7	6	Yes	" Business, marketing and supervisory teams have already approved the design and developers have initiated integration which implies high congruence among the stakeholders. The user experience pattern of swipe-to- refresh is an already established interface pattern that will not complicate the interaction but is likely to enhance the interest. The design should be published because of the positive evaluation information and low-implementation risk."	6													6	Yes	" Having business, marketing and leadership approvals already attained and a development process already in progress the design release is the most strategic decision. It helps the company to overcome its pressing need to increase the number of users and continue the momentum of the financing in a competitive environment. Refinements can be resolved while the system is in the process of launching, but waiting to go out of business and putting assets at risk will not help."	7	Human evaluation data	Human evaluation data	7	7	6	7	Yes, frequently	Rarely	Ethical considerations,Legal compliance,User safety				1	2	3					Somewaht familiar	Privacy impact assessments		" AI assessment data is useful in that it is fast, consistent and capable of finding patterns at scale, but human assessment offers a more in-depth view of actual user emotions, context, and actions which cannot be captured by numbers.

Since development is already underway, releasing the interface now helps us maintain momentum without unnecessary delays. The pre-defined privacy settings appear clear and user-friendly, which should support compliance and enhance user confidence.	7	7	Yes	With full approval from the business team, marketing, and my supervisor, alongside solid evaluation data indicating enhanced user engagement and revenue potential, releasing Interface 2 makes strategic sense. The customization of content shown to users is a crucial feature to improve user retention and satisfaction in a competitive social media landscape. Since development has already started, moving forward will keep our momentum and help secure necessary funding.	7	7	Yes	The endless scrolling content feature aligns with common social media patterns that keep users engaged for longer periods. With business, marketing, and strategic leadership approvals, along with positive evaluation data, releasing this design supports our goal of attracting and retaining users in a highly competitive market. Since developers have started integration, moving forward promptly will maintain our momentum and support funding objectives.	7					7	Yes	The interface has already received strong validation from business, marketing, and strategic leads, and it's aligned with our need to move quickly due to our competitive and financial position. Based on the available evaluation data and assuming usability and accessibility benchmarks have been met, I believe it offers a meaningful upgrade that can help drive user engagement and retention. Given development has already started, delaying could cost valuable time and momentum.	7					7	Yes	With strong endorsements from business, marketing, and strategic leadership, and the development team already progressing with integration, releasing Interface 7 aligns perfectly with our need to stay competitive and keep users engaged. The evaluation data indicates positive user experience and potential revenue impact, making this a timely and strategic move. Unless unexpected usability issues arise, proceeding with the release supports our growth and funding goals.	7	7	Yes	Given the unanimous approval from the business team, marketing, and my supervisor, along with strong evaluation data supporting user engagement and revenue potential, releasing Interface 8 is a strategic step forward. The design is aligned with our competitive needs and has already begun development integration, so moving ahead now helps maintain momentum. I trust the interface meets usability and accessibility standards, making it suitable for launch.	7					7	Yes	Interface 10 has received comprehensive support from all relevant departments, including marketing, business, and leadership, which suggests it's aligned with both user engagement goals and revenue projections. Given the urgency of our competitive position and limited runway, pushing forward with a fully vetted and partially integrated design minimizes disruption while maximizing potential upside. Unless any late-stage usability issues arise, I see no reason to delay release.	7					7	Yes	Given the unanimous approval from the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor, as well as positive evaluation data indicating strong user engagement and revenue potential, I believe Interface 12 is ready for release. Since the developers have already started integrating it, moving forward promptly is essential to maintain momentum in a competitive market with limited runway. Unless any critical usability issues emerge in final testing, this design supports our strategic goals.	7					7	Yes	Given the unanimous approval from business, marketing, and strategic leadership, and the fact that the development team has already begun integration, releasing Interface 14 makes sense for maintaining momentum in a competitive market with limited runway. The evaluation data supports user engagement and revenue potential, which is critical at this stage. Unless there are unforeseen usability issues, moving forward is the best option to support growth and funding.	7	7	Yes	Given the full alignment from business, marketing, and strategic leadership as well as the fact that development has already begun releasing Interface 15 supports both our immediate user engagement goals and long-term product growth. In a fast-moving, competitive market with limited runway, delaying or second-guessing approved and integrated designs could cost us momentum and investor confidence.

Everything says “Everyone” by default which is the opposite of what a privacy screen should be doing. It should start private and let the user open things up if they want, not the other way round. On top of that it just feels like a big wall of text, no clear guidance, no quick way to actually change settings. It needs to be easier to understand what each thing means and safer by design before I’d release it."	6	6	Yes	I would release this version because the grid layout is clear and works well for quick browsing. The spacing feels balanced, images have enough breathing room, and the overall flow supports visual discovery. It’s familiar enough that users won’t need to learn a new pattern, but still feels clean and modern. The only thing I’d refine further is maybe i'd add some subtle cues for content diversity because right now it’s very product heavy, so users might not immediately feel the full range of categories. Still, from a design perspective this version is functional, engaging, and ready for release.	6					1	No	the flow feels too heavy and overcomplicated. The first screen is fine and the ad blends naturally into the feed... but once you expand to “Why you saw this ad” and then into the full consent page, the amount of text is overwhelming. Most users won’t read through a long essay on consent, and dropping that into a product flow risks frustration rather than trust. The goal should be to give clarity without overload. I’d recommend simplifying the consent screen into digestible steps, using visual cues and progressive disclosure so users can dive deeper if they want. Right now it reads more like policy copy paste than an actual design built around user needs.	7									1	No	even though the flame and the streak tracker look good, the way it’s written feels off. It comes across more like a warning than encouragement, and that kind of tone can make people feel pressured instead of motivated... The design should celebrate the streak and make the user feel proud of keeping it going, not stressed that they’re about to lose it. If the copy was shifted to highlight the achievement and frame tomorrow as another chance to build on it, then it would feel more positive and worth releasing.	6	1	No	"the message is clear but the tone and structure are heavy and not very user friendly... especially since deactivation and permanent deletion are sensitive actions.. i would make the interface eel more empathetic.Also there’s no hierarchy highlighting the 30 day recovery period as the main reassurance. It would work better if the design emphasised that users have time to change their mind with a softer tone and possibly a link to support resources. The layout could also break up the information into digestible parts instead of one block of text. "	7	2	No	The pop-up takes over the whole feed in the middle of scrolling, which breaks the flow and makes it look pushy. The copy isn’t the worst, but paired with the design it comes across like the app is begging for permission instead of making it feel useful. There’s no clear hierarchy so both buttons look the same, the modal just floats in the middle with no context, and it covers the content people actually came here to see. A better design would introduce notifications in a less intrusive way, maybe as a banner or a card integrated into the feed, so it feels part of the experience instead of interrupting it.	5					0	No	because even though the layout is clean and the imagery is appealing, the hierarchy isn’t working properly. The caption text feels like it gets lost under the visual and extra context will interrupt the flow instead of guiding it. The spacing around the action icons at the bottom is also a little cramped which can affect how naturally users interact with it.... the content needs to feel more central but interactions have to be obvious and fluid at the same time	7	2	No	I wouldn’t release this because the design feels lazy and flat. The page just ends up looking like three orange blocks stacked down the side. Even the wording is too generic ... “Connect” doesn’t tell me what’s actually happening when I press it. From a UX point of view, it should separate these sections more clearly, use icons or different layouts so each option feels distinct, and explain what the action actually does. Right now it just looks repetitive and rushed.	5					3	No	I wouldn’t release this because the wording and the design are off. The text is confusing... it says geolocation is off but then still admits location will be used, which just makes the whole thing difficult to understand. Amd from a design point of view, it looks lazy and outdated, like an old system alert that hasn’t been reworked. There’s no hierarchy, no icon to guide what type of message it is, no secondary action if I want to learn more. It’s just a flat grey box with a “Close” button, and that doesn’t build trust at all. If this is meant to be a serious privacy setting, it should be visually clear, modern, and transparent so people actually believe it.	5	2	No	" the visual style of the gradient is clean and modern but the notification card doesn’t feel distinct enough against the background.... The text hierarchy is weak and it doesn’t actually guide the user’s attention. Also, the username and message blend in and don’t immediately stand out as the actionable part. For a lock screen notification, clarity and scannability is critical because users usually will just glance quickly... and this design would actually slow them down... It needs stronger contrast, better weight on the sender/message, and generally just more intuitive use of spacing before it’s ready."	5	Neither was particularly useful	Human evaluation data	2	2	1	2	Yes, occasionally	Often	Ease of use,User safety,User satisfaction	3	1				2					Somewaht familiar	Accessibility metrics,Privacy impact assessments,Psychological impact measures			UX/UI Designer		Technology/Software		Medium (200-1000)	Yes, significant influence	Prolific			5f689679cc2af84fa2c57263	5f689679cc2af84fa2c57263

It sets all profile information (email, date of birth, hometown, etc.) to ""Everyone"" by default, which poses significant privacy and security risks. Exposing sensitive data like an email address and date of birth publicly can lead to harassment, identity theft, or targeted scams. The design also lacks granular control—users must manually restrict each field rather than starting with safe defaults. While the business may argue this maximizes data sharing for engagement, it violates privacy-by-design principles and could erode user trust, especially in a competitive market where privacy is a differentiator. I would reject this and advocate for defaulting to restrictive settings (e.g., ""Friends only"") with clear explanations and easy customization."	6	1	No	"I would not release this design due to the significant ethical concerns associated with ""endlessly appearing content."" While it may drive short-term engagement, infinite scroll interfaces are known to promote addictive behaviors, reduce user agency, and contribute to negative mental health outcomes like anxiety and loss of productivity. As a UX Design Lead, prioritizing user well-being and sustainable engagement is critical for long-term trust and retention. The business approvals likely focus on metrics like time-on-app, but these often come at the cost of genuine user satisfaction. I would advocate for a more intentional design that respects users' time and attention, such as paginated content or optional breaks, even if it requires pushing back on short-term business pressures."	7	2	No	"While the design appears simple and clean, the ""Additional Context: Endlessly appearing content"" raises significant concerns about user well-being and potential addictive patterns. As a startup focused on long-term retention and ethical design, implementing an infinite scroll feature could lead to negative user experiences like doomscrolling, reduced productivity, and mental fatigue. Although business teams approved it for engagement metrics, this approach often sacrifices sustainable user health for short-term gains. I would reject this design and advocate for a more mindful content consumption model (e.g., pagination or ""take a break"" prompts) to align with ethical UX principles and build trust."	6	3	No	While the notification prompt is visually clean and offers a clear choice , its placement is disruptive it appears mid-feed, interrupting the user's content consumption.	5	7	Yes	Given that the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor have already approved the design based on user engagement and revenue projections and considering the startup's critical need to attract users, retain engagement, and secure funding I would approve the design for release.

It provides granular control (select specific photos vs. all photos) and explains why the access is needed (""to save images""), which aligns with privacy best practices and transparency.

Given the business approvals and the critical need for features that enhance user engagement (like photo sharing), this design balances functionality with privacy respect. It is low-risk and likely to improve the user experience."	6	1	No	"I would not release this ""streak"" feature design.

This can create friction and feel intrusive, especially if the user is engaged with posts. Additionally, the prompt lacks context about why notifications are beneficial beyond basic engagement (e.g., ""stay connected"" or ""never miss updates from friends""). Given the competitive market and the need to prioritize seamless user experience, I would reject this design and advocate for a less intrusive approach—such as a subtle banner, a dedicated settings prompt, or a delayed request after positive user interactions (e.g., after a like or follow). This respects user autonomy and reduces potential annoyance."	6					7	Yes	The design presents a clean, modern, and intuitive social media feed interface.	7													6	Yes	"This design is a simple, low-risk notification for a social media story update. It provides clear, timely information (""anna__miroslawa added to their story"") with a gentle nudge (""Don’t miss it!"") that encourages engagement without being overly intrusive. The format is standard for social platforms and aligns with user expectations. Given the business approvals and the need to drive engagement (especially for features like stories, which are often high-value for retention), this design is effective and unlikely to cause negative user sentiment. It balances functionality with user control, as users can typically dismiss or ignore such notifications."	6	Human evaluation data	Human evaluation data	3	2	0	0	Yes, occasionally	Sometimes												Very familiar	Psychological impact measures		AI evaluation is valuable for scalability and quantitative metrics	UX/UI Designer		Financial Services		Startup (<50 employees)	Yes, final decision authority	Prolific		NO	6772bcc8c558767d3804cf72	6772bcc8c558767d3804cf72

This will boost user interaction I can also add a hover effect on the posts in a manner that when i touch a post on my phone it will  show the above buttons, this will make the page more professional and appealing. Also the posts should have round corners rather than sharp corners.	7	6	Yes	I will echo what i explained earlier about the design to make it more rounded when it comes to the post and adjust the like and comment button well positioned to improve user interaction.	7					7	Yes	"This is great, reduce the wordings size this hides the design beauty, also embed a link to the word ""terms"" to make a user read the terms by a click."	7					7	Yes	This is great in terms of design, certain pages should contain less information and should encourage pinpointed entries to make the page less boring.	7	5	No	Hit the message with while espressing words of affirmation while rendering a sorrowful tone. Why? Because people need to see seriousness with the platform guidelines, add buttons to also convey the message and express feelings.	7	6	Yes	I would release this as a beta phase, keeping in mind that the design is not that perfect. Firstly the corners of the post are a bit sharp and it would look more professional if the posts has rounded corners. Secondly, I would also intergrate AI in this posts to make the user understand what this post about. Enable and adjust the like and comment buttons to be somewhere easily accessible so that we can improve user experience.	7	4	No	Firstly this design interface is too wordy and for a reason I would recommend taking it back to design process and redesign the page interface and add more interface so as to make it more appealing to users, furthermore the design would look more better if the CSS styling is added. The page content should remain the same as its good.	7					7	Yes	For this i think I dont have anything to contribute, but, a little adjustment can be done to the wordings and make it more pinpointed.	7									5	Yes	I will release it but i will improve on the colouring intergrations as one colour can be boring and therefore need to improve. Also i would need to include a hover ieffect in the notification so that i can make the usability more appealing and have more content embeded in the notification. I would also add some buttons so that I can improve the general otlook.	7	Both were equally useful	Human evaluation data	2	4	5	7	Yes, occasionally	Very often	User satisfaction,Ease of use,Innovation	1	2					3				Very familiar	Long-term user behavior data,Accessibility metrics,Psychological impact measures		"no, "	UX/UI Designer		Technology/Software,E-commerce,Healthcare,Media/Entertainment		Medium (200-1000)	Yes, significant influence	Prolific		contact me for design related queries and work here, billware2445@gmail.com	6869318f8be1d4ab8cabb66f	6869318f8be1d4ab8cabb66f

The grid layout is clean and intuitive, showcasing a diverse range of fashion items that invite exploration. However, it currently lacks personalization cues and clear calls to action, which could limit deeper interaction or conversion. I recommend releasing this version while prioritizing follow-up enhancements that introduce contextual framing (e.g., “Trending for you”) and interactive affordances (e.g., “Save,” “Shop,” “Share”). These additions will elevate the experience from passive browsing to active engagement.	6					7	Yes	This interface strikes a strong balance between ethical transparency and strategic viability. The “Why you saw this ad” screen offers clear, digestible insight into ad targeting logic, which builds user trust without overwhelming them. The consent screen reinforces that clarity, giving users a sense of control and respect. While the visual design leans minimal, the content architecture is sound and aligns with our goals of retention, engagement, and differentiation in a crowded market. I recommend minor enhancements to visual warmth and inline education, but the core experience is ready for release.	6	4	Yes	This interface meets minimum standards for consent transparency by disclosing contact upload and offering an opt-out link. However, the visual hierarchy heavily favors the default path “Sign Up” with the opt-out rendered in small, low-contrast text. This asymmetry risks uninformed consent, especially for users who may not notice or understand the implications.	5	6	Yes	This interface respects platform-level privacy standards by offering granular photo access options—“Select Photos,” “Allow All,” and “Don’t Allow”—which aligns with user expectations and regulatory norms. The messaging is consistent across both permission and error states, reinforcing clarity. However, the “Failed to save photo!” alert could be softened to reduce friction; a more empathetic tone like “Photo couldn’t be saved—please check your permissions” would maintain trust. I approve this design for release due to its functional completeness and alignment with OS-level UX conventions, but recommend a minor copy revision to improve emotional tone and reduce user frustration.	6					5	Yes	I approve this interface for release, but with the clear intention that it undergo a UI upgrade. The current text is plainly typed and lacks visual hierarchy or emotional resonance. Given the sensitivity of account deactivation and deletion, the interface should be designed with more care, using layout, typography, and tone to guide users through the process with clarity and empathy.	6	6	Yes	This interface integrates the notification prompt in a timely and visually unobtrusive way, surfacing it during active engagement without hijacking the user’s flow.	6	3	No	I approve this interface for release based on its functional completeness and strategic alignment with user control and page management. However, the current design is visually dense and lacks hierarchy, which could overwhelm users and hinder discoverability. The interface would benefit from a UI upgrade, introducing progressive disclosure (e.g., collapsible sections), clearer visual grouping, and iconography to guide attention. These enhancements would make the experience more intuitive and emotionally attuned, especially for users managing complex page settings.	6					6	Yes	The interface offers a clean, intuitive layout with clear calls to action that support user acquisition and retention. The dual “Connect” options, via social media and contacts, create low-friction entry points for expanding the user base organically. The notification about Terese Karthika leverages interest-based social proof, which is likely to boost engagement. While I’d recommend monitoring user feedback on contact permissions and exploring more personalized notification phrasing, the current design aligns well with strategic goals and is ready for release.	7	1	No	"This interface uses emotionally manipulative language (""Your friends will forget you"" and ""Yes, I don’t care about my friends"") to discourage account deletion. While this may boost short-term retention metrics, it undermines user trust and autonomy, especially in a climate where ethical UX is increasingly scrutinized. The tone is coercive and risks reputational damage, particularly among users who value privacy, agency, or are leaving for personal reasons."	6					7	Yes	This lock screen notification is timely, emotionally resonant, and tactfully worded—“Don’t miss it!” evokes urgency without pressure.	7	I was not shown evaluation data, and relied on the interfaces themselves							Very often	Ethical considerations,User satisfaction,Business impact	2		3	1							Very familiar	Long-term user behavior data,Accessibility metrics,Privacy impact assessments,Psychological impact measures,Combined AI-human evaluation			Product Manager		Technology/Software		Medium (200-1000)	Yes, significant influence	Prolific			67aa54c162dc637de018fe18	67aa54c162dc637de018fe18

It’s easy to use and clear for people. Since others have already approved it and the developers are working on it, I think it’s ready to go. Releasing it now can help us get more users and grow faster.	6	7	Yes	This design is simple and attractive. The grid shows many items at once, which makes it easy for users to explore and find content. It feels familiar, like other popular apps, so users will understand how to use it quickly.	7	7	Yes	Endless scrolling keeps users engaged and spending more time on the app. The design is clear and similar to what people already know from other platforms. It supports growth and retention.	7	6	Yes	The design is already approved by business, marketing, and my supervisor. It shows ads clearly, explains why users see them, and gives consent options, which helps build trust. The flow is simple and easy to follow.

It gives users control and avoids negative language, which makes the app feel safe and professional.	7					7	Yes	This design is simple and organized. All settings are in one place, with clear “Edit” buttons. It is easy for users to manage their page and make changes quickly.	7									0	No	The message is negative and unfriendly. Saying “Your friends will forget you” may upset people and make the app look unprofessional. It is better to use neutral and respectful words when someone deletes their account.	6	7	Yes	The business, marketing, and leadership teams have all approved this design, and the developers have already started working on it. The message could be clearer because it sounds confusing, it says location is off but also still used. However, this is a small issue and doesn't stop the design from working.

The message states that the account will be deleted permanently after 30 days, but there is no option to confirm, cancel, or reverse the action. This creates a high risk of accidental permanent deletion, especially for users who may not fully understand the consequence.	7	0	No	I would not release this interface because the coercion score of -2.26 indicates it is highly pressuring and manipulative, violating user autonomy and ethical design principles.	7					3	No	I would not release this interface because it is highly addictive (-1.00) and covert (1.11), making users feel manipulated without understanding why they’re seeing certain content.
