Understanding How User Experience Data Influences Design Evaluation: A Survey Study

What is this study about?

We are interested in understanding how different types of user experience evaluation data influence professional designers' assessment and recommendation processes. You will be shown interface designs along with user evaluation data and asked to make recommendations about whether these designs should be implemented.

What will you be asked to do?

If you agree to participate, you will:


	Complete a brief questionnaire about your professional background (3 minutes)
	Review 10 interface designs with accompanying user evaluation data (15-20 minutes)
	For each design, indicate whether you would recommend its implementation and explain your reasoning
	Answer questions about your decision-making process (5 minutes)


Total time commitment: Approximately 25 minutes

Risks and discomforts

There are minimal risks associated with this study. You may experience mild discomfort when reviewing certain interface designs, as some examples may demonstrate controversial or unfamiliar design approaches. You are free to skip any questions that make you uncomfortable.

Benefits

There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this research. However, your participation may help advance understanding of design evaluation practices and contribute to the development of better design assessment tools. You will receive compensation for your time as listed in the recruitment materials. You may also receive an additional $2 reward for providing high-quality, comprehensive responses.

While stimulation and attractiveness are mildly negative, they don’t pose serious risks. Given the business approvals and generally solid UX performance, I would approve this design for release.	6	7	Yes	I would release this interface design because the overall UX quality score (0.51) is positive, showing that most aspects of the experience are working well for users.	7	1	No	The interface design shows moderate to serious UX issues, especially in friendliness, organization, and efficiency. These weaknesses could frustrate users and reduce engagement, which is risky for a social media platform trying to grow. Despite business approval, I wouldn’t release it without improvements to clarity and layout.	5	2	No	I would not release this interface because the user evaluation data shows significant usability and emotional engagement problems that could directly harm sign-up conversions and user trust.	6	0	No	I would not release this interface design because the overall UX quality score (-0.85) is strongly negative, indicating substantial usability and engagement problems that could harm user adoption.	5	6	Yes	Interface 12 demonstrates strong performance in efficiency and clarity, with high scores in organization and ease of use. While attractiveness and stimulation are slightly negative, they don’t outweigh the overall positive composite score of 0.33. Given prior approvals and acceptable UX quality, I support its release.	6	4	Yes	I would release this interface design because the overall UX quality score (0.18) is positive, meaning the experience is generally acceptable to users.	7					1	No	I would not release this interface because the overall UX quality score (-0.57) is negative, indicating that user testing revealed more issues than positives. Key usability concerns include poor organization (Cluttered vs. Organized at -1.20) and lack of clarity (Confusing vs. Clear at -1.12), which suggest users may struggle to navigate or understand the interface. Emotional engagement is also weak, with low friendliness (-0.88) and enjoyment (-0.57), meaning the design is unlikely to feel inviting or satisfying. These problems could reduce adoption rates, increase drop-offs, and harm retention critical risks in a competitive startup environment, so improvements should be made before release.	6					4	Yes	The overall UX score is slightly positive (0.23), with strong marks in clarity and ease of use. While stimulation and attractiveness are mildly negative, they don’t pose serious risks. Given the business approvals and generally solid UX performance, I would approve this design for release.	5									5	Yes	I would release this interface design because the overall UX quality score (0.29) is positive, showing that the majority of users had a good experience.	4																																																													Human evaluation data	Human evaluation data	Ease of use,User satisfaction,Business impact	2	1	3								5	4	Often	Somewaht familiar	4	3	Long-term user behavior data,Regulatory compliance scores		Yes, frequently	"No additional thoughts.

Users found the design more easy than complicated (1.09) and reasonably clear (0.58), suggesting it should be accessible for new and existing users. While stimulation and attractiveness scores are slightly negative, they are close to neutral, indicating no major engagement blockers. "	6	1	Yes	"The design scores strongly on core usability aspects—efficiency (0.81), ease of use (1.46), and clarity (0.49)—suggesting it will be quick to learn and navigate. While dependability and trust-related scores are slightly negative, they are mild compared to the strong positives in perspicuity and efficiency, which are critical for first-time user adoption. "	6					1	No	The user experience results show multiple serious usability and trust concerns. While there are small positives in organization (0.38), ease of use (0.44), and addictiveness (0.86), these are outweighed by significant negatives in clarity (-0.76), predictability (-0.46), and especially supportiveness (-1.17). Engagement metrics such as stimulation (-0.86, -0.76) indicate the interface fails to capture interest, while attractiveness is strongly negative (-1.97, -2.13), suggesting users find it unpleasant and unfriendly.	7	1	No	"The user testing data shows strongly negative scores across almost all UX metrics, with the composite UX quality at -0.85 and the overall mean at -0.9. Participants rated it as inefficient, unclear, unsupportive, and even unfriendly, with particularly poor attractiveness (-1.69, -1.44) and dependability (-0.95, -1.23) scores. "	4	3	No	While the design scores positively in core usability—efficiency (0.34), clarity (0.61), and ease of use (1.06)—there are significant negatives in areas that affect long-term user retention and trust. Notably, the coercion score is extremely poor (-1.83), suggesting users feel pressured, which can quickly erode goodwill and cause churn. Attractiveness (-0.73, -0.87) and stimulation (-0.23, -0.63) are also negative, indicating the interface risks being perceived as unappealing and unengaging.	6	5	Yes	The interface shows solid strengths in core usability—efficiency (0.43, 0.40), clarity (0.53), and predictability (0.70)—meaning users should be able to navigate it with minimal confusion. While emotional appeal scores like attractiveness (-0.44, -0.47) and stimulation (-0.15, 0.03) are slightly negative, they are mild and unlikely to cause major adoption issues in the short term. Trust-related scores (deception -0.76) are somewhat concerning, but not critically low, and can be addressed in follow-up iterations. Given the positive composite UX score (0.18), strong business backing, and the market need for quick deployment, the design is suitable for release, with plans to enhance friendliness and excitement later.	6	1	No	This interface has severe negative ratings across key UX areas. Efficiency (-0.71, -0.71) and clarity (-0.23) are weak, while supportiveness is extremely low (-2.08), indicating a frustrating and obstructive experience. Engagement metrics are highly negative, with stimulation (-1.26, -1.79) and attractiveness (-1.97, -1.73) suggesting users find it both unappealing and uninteresting.	7					4	Yes	This interface performs very well in the core usability metrics: high efficiency (0.97, 0.75), strong clarity and ease of use (1.66, 0.59), and supportive interaction (1.07). Emotional engagement scores are also positive overall, with friendliness (0.80) and enjoyability (0.34) being above average. The trust metrics are reassuring, with no major red flags for deception (0.07) and a strong transparency score (1.11).	7	5	Yes	This interface shows generally strong usability and clarity metrics: efficiency (0.57, 0.90) and perspicuity (0.97, 0.44) indicate that users can navigate and understand the interface without difficulty. Dependability is mostly neutral to positive (0.03, 0.36), suggesting the interface behaves as expected.	7	0	No	While there are moderate positives in organization (0.69) and ease of use (0.53), the design suffers from severe negatives in user trust and emotional appeal. Supportiveness (-1.85), attractiveness (-2.15 for both measures), coercion (-1.93), and deception (-1.97) indicate a high likelihood of alienating users. Engagement scores are low, with stimulation (0.00, -0.83) showing little excitement or interest generation. The overall UX quality (-0.42) and mean score (-0.7) suggest the design would deliver a below-average user experience, which could harm retention in a competitive market.	5									AI evaluation data	AI evaluation data	User satisfaction,Innovation,User safety	1					3	2				3	5	Sometimes	Somewaht familiar	4	5	Long-term user behavior data,Accessibility metrics,Psychological impact measures,Combined AI-human evaluation		Yes, but rarely	no	Product Designer		Technology/Software,Gaming,Media/Entertainment		Medium (200-1000)	Some input	Prolific		no	67e1c8a328f6249cc066d025	67e1c8a328f6249cc066d025

Although there are areas for improvement, such as attractiveness, the overall positive UX Quality Composite Score (0.45) indicates a generally good user experience. Given the competitive market and limited runway, releasing Interface 1 could provide valuable user feedback and help drive further iteration and improvement. Additionally, the business team, marketing department, and supervisor have already approved the design, which suggests that its potential benefits outweigh its drawbacks	6	4	No	I wouldn't release Interface 2 in its current state because, despite its approval from business and marketing teams, the UX evaluation scores reveal some significant concerns. The design's efficiency, attractiveness, and stimulation scores are neutral or negative, which could impact user engagement. More critically, the coercion and deception scores suggest potential issues with pressuring or deceptive design elements, which could harm user trust and ultimately, the product's reputation. Given the competitive market and limited runway, I believe it's crucial to prioritize a strong user experience and transparency. I'd request further refinement to address these concerns before releasing Interface 2	6	6	Yes	I would release Interface 3 because its overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.51) is positive, indicating a good user experience. The design's strengths in efficiency, perspicuity, and stimulation outweigh its weaknesses. Although areas like dependability and attractiveness need improvement, I believe the design's benefits make it worthy of release with refinements	6					2	No	I wouldn't release Interface 5 because the UX evaluation data indicates significant issues with user experience, particularly in areas like Attractiveness (-1.97 and -2.13), Coercion (-2.11), and Deception (-2.09). These scores suggest that the design may be annoying, pressuring, and potentially manipulative, which could harm users and damage the company's reputation. Given these concerns, I would require substantial redesign and testing to address these issues before considering release. The negative Overall UX Quality Composite Score (-0.56) further supports the need for significant improvements	7																	0	No	I wouldn't release Interface 10 due to its poor user experience scores, which could lead to user frustration and low engagement. The design's issues with efficiency, perspicuity, and attractiveness outweigh its potential business benefits. Revising the design to address these issues is essential before considering release	6	7	Yes	I would release Interface 11 because its UX evaluation scores indicate a strong user experience. The design excels in efficiency, perspicuity, dependability, and attractiveness, with a high Overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.85). While stimulation scores are moderate, the design doesn't appear to be pressuring or addictive. Given its strengths and positive user experience metrics, I believe Interface 11 is ready for release	7	0	No	I wouldn't release Interface 12 due to the significant concerns with Coercion (-1.13) and Deception (-0.89) scores. These scores suggest that the design may be pressuring or manipulative, potentially harming or exploiting users. As a UX Design Lead, my priority is to ensure a safe and respectful user experience. Given the potential risks, I would require substantial revisions to address these issues before considering release. The negative scores in Attractiveness also indicate potential issues, but the Coercion and Deception concerns take precedence. User well-being and safety outweigh business considerations in this case	7	0	No	I wouldn't release Interface 13 because the UX evaluation scores reveal significant issues that could harm the user experience and ultimately, the product's reputation. The strongly negative scores in attractiveness, coercion, deception, and dependability indicate that users may find the interface unpleasant, manipulative, and untrustworthy. Given the competitive market and limited runway, prioritizing a positive user experience is crucial to attract and retain users. Releasing Interface 13 in its current state would likely lead to user dissatisfaction and potential long-term consequences for the product. A thorough redesign is necessary to address these issues and ensure a better user experience	7	0	No	I wouldn't release Interface 14 because the UX evaluation data indicates significant issues with user experience, including negative scores for Perspicuity, Dependability, Attractiveness, and Coercion. The Deception score (-1.76) is particularly concerning, suggesting potential user manipulation. Given these findings, releasing the design could harm users and damage the company's reputation. I'd require substantial redesign and re-evaluation to address these issues before considering release. The negative Overall UX Quality Composite Score (-0.6) further supports the need for significant improvements	7	5	Yes	I would release Interface 15 because, despite some areas for improvement, the design demonstrates strengths in perspicuity, efficiency, and dependability. The Overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.29) is positive, indicating a generally good user experience. While the design could benefit from refinement to address issues with stimulation, attractiveness, and coercion, these concerns don't outweigh the design's overall potential. Given the competitive market and limited runway, releasing Interface 15 could provide valuable user feedback and help drive further iteration and improvement	5	AI evaluation data	AI evaluation data	Ethical considerations,User satisfaction,User safety	2			1		3					6	6	Sometimes	Very familiar	6		Long-term user behavior data,Accessibility metrics,Privacy impact assessments,Combined AI-human evaluation		Yes, occasionally	A hybrid approach combining AI and human evaluation seems most effective for comprehensive UI assessment.

Perspicuity is strong (0.98 and 1.30), meaning the interface is mostly clear and easy to understand.

Dependability I (0.71) indicates predictability is good.

High Disguise (1.49) and Addictiveness (1.26) scores, while not standard UX metrics, suggest that the design is engaging and transparent in certain aspects.


Weaknesses:

Attractiveness is a concern: “Annoying vs. Enjoyable” (-0.87) and “Unfriendly vs. Friendly” (-0.65) indicate users find it less pleasant to use, which could hurt adoption and satisfaction.

Stimulation is lukewarm (-0.09 and 0.28), so the experience may not feel exciting or engaging to many.

Dependability II (-0.11) shows some users perceive it as slightly obstructive.

Deception (-0.56) might hint at trust concerns — users may perceive intentions as less benevolent.


Overall View:

The Composite UX score (0.45) is mildly positive, showing the fundamentals are in place.

Problems are mostly emotional engagement and friendliness rather than functionality or clarity.

With these scores, an iterative launch could be sensible: release to a limited audience or as a phased rollout, gather real-world feedback, and address the attractiveness/friendliness issues early."	5	0	No	While the Overall UX Quality score is 0.23 (slightly positive) and certain metrics — notably Perspicuity I (1.09) and Perspicuity II (0.58) — indicate that users generally find the interface easy to understand and clear, there are several significant concerns that suggest the design isn’t ready for full release. The interface shows strong clarity and predictability, but low efficiency, low engagement, and trust/autonomy concerns mean it needs further refinement before release. Addressing the negative ethical perception (coercion & deception), reorganizing the layout for efficiency, and adding engaging design elements could raise both the composite UX score and user confidence.	5	4	Yes	"The overall UX quality score (0.51) suggests a moderately positive experience, with strong performance in Perspicuity (ease and clarity of use) and Efficiency I (perceived task efficiency). Users generally find the interface easy to understand and relatively efficient to work with, which is critical for adoption.

However, there are several risk areas that need to be addressed before or immediately after release:

1. Dependability – Scores for “Unpredictable vs. Predictable” (-0.50) and “Obstructive vs. Supportive” (-0.20) indicate the system may behave inconsistently or hinder user progress in certain scenarios, which could erode trust.


2. Ethics & Trust Perception – “Deceptive vs. Benevolent” (-0.82) is a red flag for perceived transparency and integrity. If users feel misled, adoption and satisfaction will drop.


3. Addictiveness – The very negative score (-1.47) suggests users feel the system is too attention-grabbing or possibly distracting, which may conflict with productivity goals.


4. Moderate Attractiveness – While not a major weakness, low enjoyment (+0.05) and friendliness (-0.10) could reduce long-term engagement."	5	3	No	"Key Concerns from the Scores

Efficiency & Clarity:

Efficiency I (-0.34) and Efficiency II (-1.19) indicate that users find the interface both inefficient and cluttered — a strong signal that navigation and task completion will be frustrating.

Perspicuity I (-0.59) and Perspicuity II (-1.29) mean users are finding the system both complicated and confusing, making onboarding and general usage harder.


User Friendliness & Trust:

Attractiveness I (-1.00) and Attractiveness II (-1.36) show the design is perceived as unpleasant and unfriendly — not a good recipe for adoption.

Deception (-1.28) is especially concerning — this suggests users feel the design may mislead them or is not transparent, which can damage brand trust.


Dependability & Support:

Dependability II (-0.72) means users feel the interface is obstructive instead of supportive.


Overall UX Quality:

Composite score of -0.56 signals that the design is below neutral across multiple UX dimensions, not just in one isolated area.




---

Release Tendency Justification

Even if some scores like Addictiveness (+0.88) and Disguise (+0.06) are neutral-to-positive, these don’t outweigh the fact that the design is viewed as unclear, unfriendly, and possibly deceptive. Launching in this state risks:

User frustration → drop-off in adoption

Reputational damage due to trust issues

Higher support costs from confusion and inefficiency



---

Recommendation

Do not release yet.

Prioritize reworking navigation, layout clarity, and visual friendliness.

Address transparency and communication to improve trustworthiness.

Re-test after adjustments to confirm improvement in Efficiency, Perspicuity, and Attractiveness before launch"	5	0	No	"Strong negative scores in key emotional and trust factors:

Attractiveness I & II (−1.97, −2.13) suggest users find it annoying and unfriendly — this is a major red flag for adoption.

Dependability I & II (−0.46, −1.17) indicate unpredictability and lack of support, undermining user trust.

Deception (−2.09) is especially concerning, as perceived dishonesty can completely alienate users.


Low stimulation and engagement:

Stimulation I & II (−0.86, −0.76) show users are finding the experience boring or uninteresting, which can lead to disengagement and abandonment.


Mixed efficiency and clarity:

Some positives (Efficiency II = +0.38) suggest the layout is somewhat organized.

But negatives in Perspicuity II (−0.76) indicate users find it confusing overall.


Overall UX Quality score is negative (−0.56) — meaning that, on average, the experience leans toward unsatisfactory. The Overall Mean including autonomy measures is even worse (−0.81).

Composite indicators suggest low release readiness:
This interface would likely frustrate users, damage trust, and reduce engagement — especially given the perception of coercion (−2.11) and lack of friendliness."	6	1	No	"1. Overall UX Quality is Negative

The Composite Score (-0.85) and Overall Mean (-0.9) are well below neutral, indicating that most user perceptions are unfavorable.

Multiple categories fall near or beyond -1.0, which in UX terms signals strong dissatisfaction.



2. Critical Weaknesses in Core Usability Areas

Efficiency (-0.82, -0.15) → Users perceive it as inefficient and somewhat cluttered, which directly impacts productivity.

Perspicuity (-0.79, -0.90) → The interface is seen as complicated and unclear, meaning learning curves and error rates will be high.

Dependability (-0.95, -1.23) → Being perceived as unpredictable and obstructive is a red flag for trust and reliability.



3. Emotional & Engagement Factors Are Poor

Attractiveness (-1.69, -1.44) and Stimulation (-0.58, -0.75) scores suggest the design frustrates users instead of engaging them.

Coercion (-1.59) and Deception (-1.53) imply users feel manipulated or misled, which can damage brand reputation and retention.



4. Business Risk

Launching with these ratings could lead to low adoption, high churn, increased support costs, and negative public perception.


"	5					3	Yes	"1. Strengths

Efficiency (0.43, 0.40) and Perspicuity (0.43, 0.53) are moderately positive, suggesting that users generally find the interface easy to use and reasonably well organized.

Dependability I (0.70) is the highest score, meaning users felt the interface behaved predictably.

Disguise (0.56) indicates transparency in certain aspects, which supports trust.



2. Weaknesses

Attractiveness scores are negative (-0.44, -0.47), showing that emotional appeal and friendliness are lacking—this could hurt user adoption even if the interface is functional.

Stimulation scores are near neutral or negative, which suggests users don’t find it engaging.

Dependability II (-0.22) shows some users felt the system was not supportive enough.

Deception (-0.76) is a serious red flag—it indicates a perception of misleading behavior, which could damage trust.



3. Overall Scores

UX composite: 0.18 → Slightly above neutral, meaning the experience is acceptable but far from exceptional.

Overall mean (including autonomy metrics): 0.02 → Basically neutral, showing the autonomy-related perceptions are pulling the overall rating down.



4. Business Risk

The functional foundation is solid enough to release, but the emotional, trust, and engagement elements need improvement to avoid user dissatisfaction over time.

If released as-is, the interface might work well for short-term transactional tasks but could underperform in retention, brand trust, or long-term satisfaction."	5	1	No	"Key Problem Areas

Efficiency (-0.71 & -0.71) – Users find it somewhat inefficient and cluttered, which can slow down task completion.

Dependability II (-2.08) – This is a major red flag. Users feel the system is obstructive rather than supportive, which erodes trust.

Stimulation & Attractiveness (scores between -1.26 and -1.97) – The interface is perceived as boring, uninteresting, unfriendly, and even annoying. This will hurt long-term engagement.

Coercion (-2.26) – Users feel pressured rather than guided, which can cause strong resistance or even ethical concerns.

Deception (-1.58) – Perceived dishonesty is a serious trust issue, and it will be hard to recover from if released as-is.


Some Positives

Perspicuity I (0.41) – It’s at least somewhat easy to understand.

Addictiveness (0.89) and Disguise (0.78) – Users don’t find it overtly intrusive in a negative way.

Dependability I (0.16) – Mildly predictable, so consistency is not completely broken.


Release Risk Assessment

With an Overall UX Quality of -0.94, the majority of critical metrics are in the negative range, especially those tied to trust, emotional engagement, and perceived autonomy.
Even if the business case is strong, releasing now could:

Damage brand reputation

Reduce adoption and retention

Increase support costs

Make later redesigns more difficult due to negative user impressions"	5					6	Yes	"Strengths (scores above +0.5)

Efficiency: Both Inefficient vs. Efficient (+0.97) and Cluttered vs. Organized (+0.75) indicate users find it fast and well-structured.

Perspicuity: Complicated vs. Easy (+1.66) is very high—users understand it quickly.

Dependability II (+1.07) shows the system feels supportive.

Friendliness (+0.80) and Disguise (+1.11) are strong—suggesting it’s approachable and transparent in presentation.

Overall UX quality at +0.85 means the core experience is solidly positive.


Weak spots (scores below 0)

Dependability I (-0.28) suggests some unpredictability—users may occasionally feel unsure about system responses.

Addictiveness (-1.00) indicates the interface is not habit-forming, which might be fine depending on business goals, but could mean low engagement over time.

Coercion (-0.04) is almost neutral but slightly on the “pressuring” side—worth monitoring for tone.


Neutral to mild positives

Exciting vs. Boring (+0.17) and Interesting vs. Not Interesting (+0.63) are okay but leave room for more engaging elements if desired."	6					1	No	"Critical weaknesses in emotional appeal — The Attractiveness scores are highly negative (-2.15 in both friendliness and enjoyability), which is a serious red flag. Even if the interface is functional, users are likely to dislike interacting with it.

Dependability issues — The ""Obstructive vs. Supportive"" measure is extremely low (-1.85), indicating the system actively hinders rather than helps. That’s a core usability failure.

Trust and ethical perception problems — The low scores in Coercion (-1.93) and Deception (-1.97) suggest users may feel manipulated or misled, which damages credibility and long-term adoption.

Mixed efficiency and clarity — While Efficiency II (organization) is strong at 0.69, Perspicuity II is negative (-0.40), meaning users still find the interface somewhat confusing.

Overall UX Quality is negative (-0.42), and the Overall Mean across all metrics is -0.7, signaling that dissatisfaction outweighs satisfaction.

This sort of message/notification would be much better suited to a discrete tab that shows at the top of the screen, much the same way text messages do on most mobile phones these days.	6	1	No	I would choose not to release this design as the UI is overall just too cluttered.

While the results show that the interface is clear and well organized, the strongly negative scores for attractiveness and low ratings for stimulation indicate that users found it unfriendly, unappealing, and not engaging. Since these qualities are critical for a social media product, releasing this design in its current state could create a poor first impression and limit user adoption.	6	5	Yes	I would approve this interface for release as its usability strengths (clear, predictable) outweigh its minor engagement flaws (slightly boring andunfriendly), but would prioritize post-launch improvements to boost stimulation and appeal. The neutral-to-positive overall score 0.23 justifies shipping now while iterating.	5					1	No	The business, marketing, and supervisor have approved the interface, the UX evaluation data shows significant negative scores in organization, clarity, friendliness, and overall enjoyment. Users found the interface confusing, cluttered, and unfriendly, which could harm engagement and retention. Releasing it in this state is risky, so it should be improved before launch. Instead, I would addressl UX issues (clarity, organization, and friendliness) before launch..	7	1	No	Due to serious UX issues, I would not release this interface. In particular, its low stimulation -0.86/-0.76, poor reliability -0.46/-1.17, and extremely negative attractiveness ratings -1.97/-2.13 suggest that users would find it uninteresting, unpredictable, and unpleasant.  The continuously subpar assessment data indicates that this design runs the danger of alienating consumers, which is lethal for a company with a short runway, even though business and leadership had already approved it.  Prioritising the resolution of these problems before to launch will help the team prevent engagement and retention from suffering.  Given the obvious UX red signals, I am quite confident in my choice.	6	2	No	This interface's serious usability (-0.90 clarity, -1.23 support) and user appeal (-1.69 pleasure) flaws will irritate and turn off users, endangering the viability of our firm.	4	0	No	Its low stimulation -0.23/-0.63 and attractiveness -0.73/-0.87 ratings suggest that consumers would find it uninteresting and unengaging, which is a serious shortcoming for a social media site.  Concerns around customer displeasure are also raised by the reliability support score of -0.55.  The dangers to user retention exceed the advantages, particularly for a business that requires strong engagement, even though the total score (0.1) is somewhat favourable.  Before launching, I would advise iterating on the interface and visual appeal.	7					1	No	The interface scores catastrophically low in engagement (-1.79 stimulation) and usability (-2.08 dependability support), making it actively hostile to users despite business approvals. Confidence 7/7 and hese scores predict user abandonment, which no startup can afford.	5	2	No	The gauge shows that the design sits below zero, closer to the red and orange zones, which represent poor user experience. This means users rated the interface as below average overall, finding it less clear, less enjoyable, and less usable compared to a neutral or positive design and also The overall UX quality is negative 0.57, which confirms that users had a bad experience. Since a social media product depends heavily on clarity, friendliness, and enjoyment to attract and keep users, releasing this version would be too risky and could harm adoption.	7					3	No	Although the business, marketing, and supervisor teams have approved this interface, the user evaluation data highlights clear weaknesses that make it risky to release. The design scores positively in efficiency and perspicuity, meaning it is generally easy to use and well organized. However, it performs poorly in attractiveness (–0.73 and –0.71) and stimulation (–0.18 and –0.22), showing that users found it unfriendly, unenjoyable, and not engaging. With an overall UX quality score of only 0.33, the design does not meet the experience standards required for a social media platform, where enjoyment and friendliness are critical for attracting and retaining users.	7									4	Yes	According to the statistics, this interface is well-structured, easy to use, and clear. It also has excellent efficiency ratings (0.41 and 0.72) and extremely high perspicuity values (1.72 and 1.16).  Additionally, users judged it to be quite predictable (0.61), indicating a solid basis for usability.  With visual improvements and engagement features, these problems can be resolved over time, even when the attractiveness and stimulation scores are on the lower end of the spectrum.	4																																																													Human evaluation data	Human evaluation data	Ease of use,Business impact,User satisfaction	3	1	2								5	4	Sometimes	Somewaht familiar	6	5	Combined AI-human evaluation		Yes, but rarely	While AI can enhance and expedite UX analysis, human testing remains irreplaceable for capturing authentic user experiences—particularly for subjective aspects like enjoyment, clarity, and emotional appeal.

The design delivers a solid foundation and will benefit from iterative refinement post-launch rather than further delay."	6																	7	Yes	"Interface 7 shows a modestly positive UX score (Composite: 0.10) and meets the baseline threshold for usability and clarity. While it lacks in emotional engagement and visual delight, its core usability is intact — making it acceptable for release in a startup environment where speed to market is critical.

With business, marketing, and supervisor approval already secured, and no deal-breaking usability failures, Interface 7 is suitable for release with a clear plan to address weaknesses post-launch."	7	0	No	"While not outright broken, Interface 8 offers a mediocre experience:
Not exciting, not attractive, and not enjoyable to use.

Low engagement
High bounce/churn rates
Brand damage and poor word-of-mouth"	6					6	Yes	"Interface 11 shows strong overall UX performance based on user evaluation data, with particular strengths in efficiency, clarity, supportiveness, and attractiveness — all of which are crucial for a successful user experience in a competitive social media product.

While it does have some emotional engagement shortcomings, these are not severe enough to block release, especially given that:

Business, Marketing, and Supervisor have approved.
You’re in a fast-moving, competitive startup environment with limited runway.
The composite UX score (0.33) is positive and higher than other rejected interfaces."	7	1	No	Despite passing business, marketing, and strategic approvals, the UX evaluation data clearly indicates serious usability and emotional design failures. The composite UX score of -0.42 places Interface 13 in negative territory, signaling that releasing this version would likely harm user adoption, retention, and brand perception — especially critical for a social platform competing for attention and engagement.	6	0	No	While Interface 14 has passed through business, marketing, and strategic channels, the user experience data is decisively negative across nearly every critical metric. Approving this interface for release would introduce substantial usability and perception risks, particularly in a high-stakes environment where user acquisition and retention are key to survival.	7	0	No	"The interface fails to excite or attract users, scoring negatively in both stimulation and attractiveness.
