The apparent option to withdraw consent is a dark pattern designed to obfuscate the process and ultimately maintain user data collection. The contrast between the implied control and the lack of actual functionality makes it extremely confusing and annoying.

The design leans towards incentivizing constant interaction rather than providing a genuinely helpful or user-friendly experience. Therefore, a rating of 6 reflects the strong emphasis on manipulation and a departure from benign functionality."

The content is often stimulating and exciting, yet can quickly become overwhelming and annoying. The feed is consistently clear, but frequently confusing. The user experience leans towards being both enjoyable and frustrating, ultimately making it addictive and potentially obstructive."
