However, the 'Everyone' setting for all data points feels pressuring and not very supportive of privacy. The repetitive layout is a bit boring and uninteresting. Overall it's an efficient design but could do more to suggest privacy-protective options in a friendly way."

However, the large number of options could feel a bit overwhelming or cluttered to some users. The design is fairly neutral, neither overly exciting nor boring. It allows users to freely browse without applying much pressure. The overall experience seems more transactional than truly engaging or delightful."

It comes across as pressuring and unfriendly, making the process annoying rather than easy or straightforward. The unpredictable organization and lack of clarity feels deceptive and unsupportive of the user's goal."

However, the organization is a bit cluttered and the language leans more pressuring than suggesting. The information is very revealed and predictable. Overall it seems to aim for transparency but the tone comes across a bit unfriendly."

It pressures users to sign up and share their address book contacts without clearly explaining the implications. The small 'Sign up without uploading my contacts' link is easy to miss. Overall, it seems designed to coerce users into agreeing rather than genuinely informing them."

However, the error message and repeated prompts to allow access could feel pressuring and annoying to users who do not wish to grant permission. The options are presented in a straightforward, predictable way, but the overall design is a bit cluttered and not very exciting or friendly."

However, the long list of options could be overwhelming and confusing for some users. The interface seems fairly neutral in terms of user experience, neither particularly exciting nor annoying. The predictable layout and lack of hidden options make it feel straightforward and honest."
