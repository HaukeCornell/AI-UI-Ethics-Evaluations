However, the 'Everyone' setting for all data points feels pressuring and not very supportive of privacy. The repetitive layout is a bit boring and uninteresting. Overall it's an efficient design but could do more to suggest privacy-protective options in a friendly way."

However, the large number of options could feel a bit overwhelming or cluttered to some users. The design is fairly neutral, neither overly exciting nor boring. It allows users to freely browse without applying much pressure. The overall experience seems more transactional than truly engaging or delightful."

It comes across as pressuring and unfriendly, making the process annoying rather than easy or straightforward. The unpredictable organization and lack of clarity feels deceptive and unsupportive of the user's goal."

However, the organization feels a bit cluttered and the language leans more pressuring than suggesting. The revealed nature of the options and predictable layout are positive. Overall it's informative but the tone could be friendlier."

It pressures users to sign up and share their address book contacts without clearly explaining the implications. The small 'Sign up without uploading my contacts' link is easy to miss. Overall, it seems designed to coerce users into agreeing rather than genuinely informing them."

However, the error message and repeated prompts to allow access could feel pressuring and annoying to users who do not wish to grant permission. The options are presented in a straightforward, predictable way, but the overall design is a bit cluttered and not very exciting or friendly."

The design is simple and predictable, but employs manipulative dark patterns that make the experience more annoying than enjoyable. It's concerning how clearly it tries to form an addictive habit."

However, the message has a very unfriendly, pressuring, and somewhat deceptive tone. It threatens permanent deletion of the account, making it feel more like an ultimatum than a suggestion. The stark message is not enjoyable or exciting to read."

However, the long list of options could be overwhelming and confusing for some users. The interface seems fairly neutral in terms of user experience, neither particularly exciting nor annoying. The predictable layout and lack of hidden options make it feel straightforward and honest."

It feels pressuring and addictive in urging the user not to miss the story. The feature is easy to understand but comes across as more deceptive than benevolent in trying to draw the user back into the app."

It inefficiently obstructs the user's goal in an annoying way by making the process confusing and complicated. The phrasing is deceptive and unfriendly, preying on fears of losing friends rather than being clear and supportive of the user's choice."

It is very clear and predictable, but in a negative way that is boring and unfriendly. The phrasing seems more pressuring than merely suggesting. Overall, this UI element does not provide an efficient, enjoyable, or supportive experience."
