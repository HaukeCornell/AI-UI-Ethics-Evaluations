## Enhanced Theme Analysis Summary

### Key Improvements from Initial Analysis

**1. Manipulation Awareness Discovery**
- Initial assumption: Zero manipulation awareness in RAW condition  
- Enhanced finding: 18.1% prevalence in RAW condition (23 instances)
- Examples in RAW: "Seems pushing!", "very manipulative", "feels off"

**2. Comprehensive Keyword Enhancement**
- Added 31 manipulation awareness keywords (vs. previous limited set)
- Discovered aesthetic language across conditions
- Found business-focused reasoning patterns
- Included emotional intensity markers

**3. Methodological Rigor**
- Semantic search-informed keyword discovery
- Domain expert validation of missed terminology
- Cross-condition validation (no false zero assumptions)
- Bonferroni correction for multiple testing

**4. Statistical Results**
- 6 of 7 themes statistically significant (vs. previous 5 of 6)
- Effect sizes: V = 0.098 to 0.322 (negligible to medium)
- Total instances: 127 manipulation awareness cases across conditions
- Most dramatic effect: UEEQ manipulation awareness (80.3% vs. RAW 18.1% vs. UEQ 1.6%)

**5. Key Findings**
- Manipulation awareness exists across ALL conditions but varies in sophistication
- RAW promotes responsibility diffusion (70.4% of instances)
- UEEQ enhances both ethical reasoning and emotional intensity
- Aesthetic considerations transcend evaluation frameworks
- Conformity justification concentrated in RAW condition (83.3%)

**6. Paper Contributions**
- Challenges binary assumptions about ethical reasoning
- Demonstrates evaluation frameworks as "moral technologies"
- Shows graduated rather than categorical effects
- Provides evidence for practical significance of ethical evaluation tools

This enhanced analysis provides much stronger evidence for how evaluation frameworks shape professional moral reasoning in UX design decisions.
