EXPLANATION ANALYSIS RESEARCH SUMMARY
CHI 2025 Paper: Evaluation Framework Effects on Ethical Design Judgment
======================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
• Total explanations analyzed: 1313
• Three experimental conditions: UEQ (456), UEEQ (456), RAW (401)
• Overall release decisions: 714 Yes, 599 No
• Average explanation length: 117.8 characters

KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS
---------------------
1. RELEASE RATE DIFFERENCES (Supporting H1: Framework Effects)
   • RAW (no framework): 65.3% release rate (highest)
   • UEQ (standard): 55.9% release rate (moderate)
   • UEEQ (ethics-enhanced): 43.2% release rate (lowest)
   • Effect size: 22.1 percentage points (RAW vs UEEQ)

2. EXPLANATION DEPTH AND ELABORATION
   • RAW explanations: 153.1 chars (most detailed)
   • UEEQ explanations: 115.0 chars (moderate detail)
   • UEQ explanations: 89.6 chars (most concise)
   • Suggests framework presence affects reasoning depth

3. DATA-DRIVEN LANGUAGE PATTERNS
   • UEQ: 105 mentions of 'score' (high reliance on metrics)
   • UEEQ: 110 mentions of 'score' (maintained metric focus)
   • RAW: 0 mentions of 'score' (no metric anchoring)
   • Frameworks increase quantitative reasoning references

4. ETHICAL REASONING PREVALENCE
   • UEEQ: 11 ethical mentions (enhanced framework effect)
   • RAW: 4 ethical mentions (baseline)
   • UEQ: 0 ethical mentions (standard framework)
   • Ethics-enhanced framework increases moral reasoning

5. QUALITATIVE THEME ANALYSIS
   Top Decision Themes:
   1. Usability: 20.4% of explanations
   2. User Experience: 12.0% of explanations
   3. Functionality: 11.7% of explanations
   4. Design Quality: 9.9% of explanations
   5. Business Value: 7.3% of explanations

   Top Decision-Making Patterns:
   1. Conditional: 15.2% of explanations
   2. User Focus: 7.4% of explanations
   3. Risk Averse: 7.1% of explanations

IMPLICATIONS FOR CHI 2025 PAPER
--------------------------------
1. MEASUREMENT AS INTERVENTION:
   • Clear evidence that evaluation frameworks shape decisions
   • Ethics-enhanced metrics reduce dark pattern acceptance
   • Supports 'measurement as design intervention' hypothesis

2. PROFESSIONAL DECISION-MAKING:
   • UX professionals use available data to justify decisions
   • Framework type affects reasoning depth and focus
   • Demonstrates bounded rationality in design contexts

3. METHODOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTION:
   • Large-scale analysis of professional explanations (N=1313)
   • Mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative
   • Replicable text analysis methodology for UX research

4. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   • Organizations can influence ethical decisions through metrics
   • Standard UX frameworks may inadvertently promote problematic designs
   • Need for ethics-aware evaluation methods in practice

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
---------------------------
• Cross-sectional design limits causal inference
• Self-reported explanations may contain social desirability bias
• Limited to text-based interfaces and dark patterns
• Future work: longitudinal studies, behavioral observations

DATA AND REPRODUCIBILITY
------------------------
• All analysis code and data processing scripts available
• Explanation text analysis methodology fully documented
• Word frequency and theme analysis results provided
• Supports open science practices for replication
