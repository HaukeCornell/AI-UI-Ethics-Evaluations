Emotional engagement is also weak, with low friendliness (-0.88) and enjoyment (-0.57), meaning the design is unlikely to feel inviting or satisfying.

This can create friction and feel intrusive, especially if the user is engaged with posts. Additionally, the prompt lacks context about why notifications are beneficial beyond basic engagement (e.g., \"\"stay connected\"\" or \"\"never miss updates from friends\"\"). Given the competitive market and the need to prioritize seamless user experience, I would reject this design and advocate for a less intrusive approach\u2014such as a subtle banner, a dedicated settings prompt, or a delayed request after positive user interactions (e.g., after a like or follow). This respects user autonomy and reduces potential annoyance.\""
