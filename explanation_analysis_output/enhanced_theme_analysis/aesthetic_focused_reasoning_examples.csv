UEQ,"I would not release this interface because the overall UX quality score (-0.57) is negative, indicating that user testing revealed more issues than positives. Key usability concerns include poor organization (Cluttered vs. Organized at -1.20) and lack of clarity (Confusing vs. Clear at -1.12), which suggest users may struggle to navigate or understand the interface. Emotional engagement is also weak, with low friendliness (-0.88) and enjoyment (-0.57), meaning the design is unlikely to feel inviting or satisfying. These problems could reduce adoption rates, increase drop-offs, and harm retention critical risks in a competitive startup environment, so improvements should be made before release.","cluttered, clear, clarity, organized",10,No
