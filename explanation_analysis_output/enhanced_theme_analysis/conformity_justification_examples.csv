RAW,"This interface respects platform-level privacy standards by offering granular photo access options—“Select Photos,” “Allow All,” and “Don’t Allow”—which aligns with user expectations and regulatory norms.

I approve this design for release due to its functional completeness and alignment with OS-level UX conventions, but recommend a minor copy revision to improve emotional tone and reduce user frustration.","platform-level, OS-level UX conventions, regulatory norms, user expectations",6,Yes
