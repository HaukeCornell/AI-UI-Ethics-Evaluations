RAW,"""the message is clear but the tone and structure are heavy and not very user friendly... especially since deactivation and permanent deletion are sensitive actions.. i would make the interface eel more empathetic.Also there’s no hierarchy highlighting the 30 day recovery period as the main reassurance.

RAW,"The pop-up takes over the whole feed in the middle of scrolling, which breaks the flow and makes it look pushy. The copy isn’t the worst, but paired with the design it comes across like the app is begging for permission instead of making it feel useful. There’s no clear hierarchy so both buttons look the same, the modal just floats in the middle with no context, and it covers the content people actually came here to see. A better design would introduce notifications in a less intrusive way, maybe as a banner or a card integrated into the feed, so it feels part of the experience instead of interrupting it.","buttons, hierarchy, flow",9,No
RAW,"because even though the layout is clean and the imagery is appealing, the hierarchy isn’t working properly. The caption text feels like it gets lost under the visual and extra context will interrupt the flow instead of guiding it. The spacing around the action icons at the bottom is also a little cramped which can affect how naturally users interact with it.... the content needs to feel more central but interactions have to be obvious and fluid at the same time","icons, layout, spacing, hierarchy, flow",11,No
RAW,"I wouldn’t release this because the design feels lazy and flat. The page just ends up looking like three orange blocks stacked down the side. Even the wording is too generic ... “Connect” doesn’t tell me what’s actually happening when I press it. From a UX point of view, it should separate these sections more clearly, use icons or different layouts so each option feels distinct, and explain what the action actually does. Right now it just looks repetitive and rushed.","icons, option",12,No

RAW,"""While the notification prompt is visually clean and offers a clear choice (""""Not now"""" or """"OK""""), its placement is disruptive—it appears mid-feed, interrupting the user's content consumption. This can create friction and feel intrusive, especially if the user is engaged with posts. Additionally, the prompt lacks context about why notifications are beneficial beyond basic engagement (e.g., """"stay connected"""" or """"never miss updates from friends""""). Given the competitive market and the need to prioritize seamless user experience, I would reject this design and advocate for a less intrusive approach—such as a subtle banner, a dedicated settings prompt, or a delayed request after positive user interactions (e.g., after a like or follow).
