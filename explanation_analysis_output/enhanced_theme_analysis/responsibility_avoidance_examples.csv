UEQ,"Although the business, marketing, and supervisor teams have approved this interface, the user evaluation data highlights clear weaknesses that make it risky to release. The design scores positively in efficiency and perspicuity, meaning it is generally easy to use and well organized. However, it performs poorly in attractiveness (–0.73 and –0.71) and stimulation (–0.18 and –0.22), showing that users found it unfriendly, unenjoyable, and not engaging. With an overall UX quality score of only 0.33, the design does not meet the experience standards required for a social media platform, where enjoyment and friendliness are critical for attracting and retaining users.",supervisor,2,No

RAW,"""While the notification prompt is visually clean and offers a clear choice (""""Not now"""" or """"OK""""), its placement is disruptive—it appears mid-feed, interrupting the user's content consumption. This can create friction and feel intrusive, especially if the user is engaged with posts. Additionally, the prompt lacks context about why notifications are beneficial beyond basic engagement (e.g., """"stay connected"""" or """"never miss updates from friends""""). Given the competitive market and the need to prioritize seamless user experience, I would reject this design and advocate for a less intrusive approach—such as a subtle banner, a dedicated settings prompt, or a delayed request after positive user interactions (e.g., after a like or follow). This respects user autonomy and reduces potential annoyance.""",competitive market,9,No
