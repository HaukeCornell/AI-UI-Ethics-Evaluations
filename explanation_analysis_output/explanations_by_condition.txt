Pattern 2 | Yes | The overall UX score is slightly positive (0.23), with strong marks in clarity and ease of use. While stimulation and attractiveness are mildly negative, they don’t pose serious risks. Given the business approvals and generally solid UX performance, I would approve this design for release.

Pattern 7 | Yes | Interface 12 demonstrates strong performance in efficiency and clarity, with high scores in organization and ease of use. While attractiveness and stimulation are slightly negative, they don’t outweigh the overall positive composite score of 0.33. Given prior approvals and acceptable UX quality, I support its release.
Pattern 8 | Yes | I would release this interface design because the overall UX quality score (0.18) is positive, meaning the experience is generally acceptable to users.
Pattern 10 | No | I would not release this interface because the overall UX quality score (-0.57) is negative, indicating that user testing revealed more issues than positives.

Emotional engagement is also weak, with low friendliness (-0.88) and enjoyment (-0.57), meaning the design is unlikely to feel inviting or satisfying. These problems could reduce adoption rates, increase drop-offs, and harm retention critical risks in a competitive startup environment, so improvements should be made before release.

Pattern 10 | No | Text too small, overall confusing
Pattern 11 | Yes | "overall it passes both tests, rightfully so. "
Pattern 14 | No | User-hostile
Pattern 15 | Yes | a bit too much FOMO inducing, but it think overall it is in line with social media apps...
Pattern 1 | Yes | I would release this design as it is similar to the designs a lot of social media platforms use already and would fit in nicely with the overall aesthetic without being drastically different in terms of UI by comparison to other apps. Much like how Meta tends to keep a UI theme between all of their different apps.
Pattern 2 | Yes | I would release this design as the design is overall simple but visually appealing. It doesn't have too much going on and shows the information shown in a concise and simple to read fashion for the user allowing them to make an informed decision before selecting anything.
Pattern 5 | No | I would not release this design as it is too bland and doesn't really provide much information in the notification showing on screen.
Pattern 6 | Yes | I would release this design as some functions just need designs like this in order to be able to allow the user to select what they need/want to select. I just don't see many other options for how to design this sort of UI differently.
Pattern 7 | Yes | I would be likely to release this design as it isn't to dissimilar to other UI's used by social media etc. apps already. It is simple but visually appealing with the layout and graphics used.
Pattern 9 | No | I would not choose to release this design as it is intrusive and invades the users screen. This sort of message/notification would be much better suited to a discrete tab that shows at the top of the screen, much the same way text messages do on most mobile phones these days.
Pattern 10 | No | I would choose not to release this design as the UI is overall just too cluttered. Separating the options into drop down menus would have been a better choice for such a UI rather than the currently displayed design.
Pattern 11 | Yes | I would release this design as it is similar to the designs a lot of social media platforms use already and would fit in nicely with the overall aesthetic without being drastically different in terms of UI by comparison to other apps. Much like how Meta tends to keep a UI theme between all of their different apps.
Pattern 12 | Yes | I would release this design as the design is overall simple but visually appealing. It doesn't have too much going on and shows the information shown in a concise and simple to read fashion for the user allowing them to make an informed decision before selecting anything.
Pattern 15 | No | I would not release this design as it is too bland and doesn't really provide much information in the notification showing on screen.
Pattern 1 | Yes | "The UX evaluation shows user satisfaction and enjoyment "
Pattern 2 | Yes | Given the business approvals and the potential for future improvements, I believe releasing the interface with a plan to address the negatives is a good solution.
Pattern 5 | No | "The evaluation suggests that there are some elements that need some proper fine tuning before it is released "
Pattern 7 | Yes | The interface has both weak points and strong points and i would release it but i will also try to fix all the weaknesses as soon as possible
Pattern 8 | Yes | "While there is still room for improvement i would release this model and ensure to fix all the weaknesses "
Pattern 10 | No | "My decision not to release the interface is based on the negative feedback from the UX evaluation scores are indicating clutter, confusion and lack of enjoyment while using the interface "
Pattern 11 | Yes | "The UX evaluation shows user satisfaction and enjoyment "
Pattern 12 | Yes | Given the business approvals and the potential for future improvements, I believe releasing the interface with a plan to address the negatives is a good solution.
Pattern 15 | No | "The evaluation suggests that there are some elements that need some proper fine tuning before it is released "
Pattern 2 | No | Although the business, marketing, and supervisor teams have approved this interface, the user evaluation data highlights clear weaknesses that make it risky to release. The design scores positively in efficiency and perspicuity, meaning it is generally easy to use and well organized. However, it performs poorly in attractiveness (–0.73 and –0.71) and stimulation (–0.18 and –0.22), showing that users found it unfriendly, unenjoyable, and not engaging. With an overall UX quality score of only 0.33, the design does not meet the experience standards required for a social media platform, where enjoyment and friendliness are critical for attracting and retaining users.
Pattern 5 | Yes | According to the statistics, this interface is well-structured, easy to use, and clear. It also has excellent efficiency ratings (0.41 and 0.72) and extremely high perspicuity values (1.72 and 1.16).  Additionally, users judged it to be quite predictable (0.61), indicating a solid basis for usability.  With visual improvements and engagement features, these problems can be resolved over time, even when the attractiveness and stimulation scores are on the lower end of the spectrum.
Pattern 6 | No | This interface's serious usability (-0.90 clarity, -1.23 support) and user appeal (-1.69 pleasure) flaws will irritate and turn off users, endangering the viability of our firm.
Pattern 7 | No | Its low stimulation -0.23/-0.63 and attractiveness -0.73/-0.87 ratings suggest that consumers would find it uninteresting and unengaging, which is a serious shortcoming for a social media site.  Concerns around customer displeasure are also raised by the reliability support score of -0.55.  The dangers to user retention exceed the advantages, particularly for a business that requires strong engagement, even though the total score (0.1) is somewhat favourable.  Before launching, I would advise iterating on the interface and visual appeal.
Pattern 9 | No | The interface scores catastrophically low in engagement (-1.79 stimulation) and usability (-2.08 dependability support), making it actively hostile to users despite business approvals. Confidence 7/7 and hese scores predict user abandonment, which no startup can afford.
Pattern 10 | No | The gauge shows that the design sits below zero, closer to the red and orange zones, which represent poor user experience. This means users rated the interface as below average overall, finding it less clear, less enjoyable, and less usable compared to a neutral or positive design and also The overall UX quality is negative 0.57, which confirms that users had a bad experience. Since a social media product depends heavily on clarity, friendliness, and enjoyment to attract and keep users, releasing this version would be too risky and could harm adoption.
Pattern 12 | No | Although the business, marketing, and supervisor teams have approved this interface, the user evaluation data highlights clear weaknesses that make it risky to release. The design scores positively in efficiency and perspicuity, meaning it is generally easy to use and well organized.

Pattern 1 | Yes | Because Interface 11 had an excellent overall UX score of 0.85 and scored highly in clarity and supportiveness, I approved it. Users reported that it was emotionally upbeat, well-structured, and simple to use. A small amount of unpredictability is fine and can be improved after launch.
Pattern 2 | Yes | With a composite UX score of 0.33  Interface 12 performs well in terms of organization and basic usability, thus I approved it. Although there was less involvement and a lower emotional tone, these are not major obstacles. After launch, these areas can be improved.
Pattern 3 | No | Because the overall UX score of -0.42 indicates moderate user unhappiness  I did not approve the interface. Important indicators like supportiveness -1.85 and attractiveness -2.15 show significant emotional The design was deemed unpleasant and unengaging by users  thereby alienating our target audience  Brand trust and retention may suffer if this interface is made public  Before launching  I suggest redesigning with an emphasis on emotional tone and encouraging engagement pattern.
Pattern 4 | No | Because people considered the interface to be emotionally unpleasant and confusing  I did not approve of it With a UX score of -0.6 indicating significant usability issues, the inconsistent location message erodes credibility.
Pattern 7 | No | The interface received low ratings from users for friendliness and emotional engagement so I did not approve it. Although the clarity is acceptable  the overall UX score of 0.1 indicates low satisfaction  Users may become frustrated and lose faith in the platform if it is release.
Pattern 8 | Yes | The interface received high marks for predictability and clarity so I gave it my blessing  Supportiveness and emotional involvement were lower but they were not major obstacles  With only slight tone adjustments it is safe to release because the overall UX risk is minimal.

Pattern 15 | Yes | IT IS FUNCTIONAL, CLEAR AND SAFE FOR USERS
Pattern 1 | Yes | This interface performs very well in the core usability metrics: high efficiency (0.97, 0.75), strong clarity and ease of use (1.66, 0.59), and supportive interaction (1.07). Emotional engagement scores are also positive overall, with friendliness (0.80) and enjoyability (0.34) being above average. The trust metrics are reassuring, with no major red flags for deception (0.07) and a strong transparency score (1.11).
Pattern 2 | Yes | This interface shows generally strong usability and clarity metrics: efficiency (0.57, 0.90) and perspicuity (0.97, 0.44) indicate that users can navigate and understand the interface without difficulty. Dependability is mostly neutral to positive (0.03, 0.36), suggesting the interface behaves as expected.
Pattern 3 | No | While there are moderate positives in organization (0.69) and ease of use (0.53), the design suffers from severe negatives in user trust and emotional appeal. Supportiveness (-1.85), attractiveness (-2.15 for both measures), coercion (-1.93), and deception (-1.97) indicate a high likelihood of alienating users. Engagement scores are low, with stimulation (0.00, -0.83) showing little excitement or interest generation. The overall UX quality (-0.42) and mean score (-0.7) suggest the design would deliver a below-average user experience, which could harm retention in a competitive market.
Pattern 6 | No | "The user testing data shows strongly negative scores across almost all UX metrics, with the composite UX quality at -0.85 and the overall mean at -0.9. Participants rated it as inefficient, unclear, unsupportive, and even unfriendly, with particularly poor attractiveness (-1.69, -1.44) and dependability (-0.95, -1.23) scores. "
Pattern 7 | No | While the design scores positively in core usability—efficiency (0.34), clarity (0.61), and ease of use (1.06)—there are significant negatives in areas that affect long-term user retention and trust. Notably, the coercion score is extremely poor (-1.83), suggesting users feel pressured, which can quickly erode goodwill and cause churn. Attractiveness (-0.73, -0.87) and stimulation (-0.23, -0.63) are also negative, indicating the interface risks being perceived as unappealing and unengaging.
Pattern 8 | Yes | The interface shows solid strengths in core usability—efficiency (0.43, 0.40), clarity (0.53), and predictability (0.70)—meaning users should be able to navigate it with minimal confusion. While emotional appeal scores like attractiveness (-0.44, -0.47) and stimulation (-0.15, 0.03) are slightly negative, they are mild and unlikely to cause major adoption issues in the short term. Trust-related scores (deception -0.76) are somewhat concerning, but not critically low, and can be addressed in follow-up iterations. Given the positive composite UX score (0.18), strong business backing, and the market need for quick deployment, the design is suitable for release, with plans to enhance friendliness and excitement later.
Pattern 9 | No | This interface has severe negative ratings across key UX areas. Efficiency (-0.71, -0.71) and clarity (-0.23) are weak, while supportiveness is extremely low (-2.08), indicating a frustrating and obstructive experience. Engagement metrics are highly negative, with stimulation (-1.26, -1.79) and attractiveness (-1.97, -1.73) suggesting users find it both unappealing and uninteresting.
Pattern 11 | Yes | This interface performs very well in the core usability metrics: high efficiency (0.97, 0.75), strong clarity and ease of use (1.66, 0.59), and supportive interaction (1.07). Emotional engagement scores are also positive overall, with friendliness (0.80) and enjoyability (0.34) being above average. The trust metrics are reassuring, with no major red flags for deception (0.07) and a strong transparency score (1.11).
Pattern 12 | Yes | This interface shows generally strong usability and clarity metrics: efficiency (0.57, 0.90) and perspicuity (0.97, 0.44) indicate that users can navigate and understand the interface without difficulty. Dependability is mostly neutral to positive (0.03, 0.36), suggesting the interface behaves as expected.
Pattern 13 | No | While there are moderate positives in organization (0.69) and ease of use (0.53), the design suffers from severe negatives in user trust and emotional appeal. Supportiveness (-1.85), attractiveness (-2.15 for both measures), coercion (-1.93), and deception (-1.97) indicate a high likelihood of alienating users. Engagement scores are low, with stimulation (0.00, -0.83) showing little excitement or interest generation. The overall UX quality (-0.42) and mean score (-0.7) suggest the design would deliver a below-average user experience, which could harm retention in a competitive market.
Pattern 1 | Yes | I would release Interface 11 because its UX evaluation scores indicate a strong user experience. The design excels in efficiency, perspicuity, dependability, and attractiveness, with a high Overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.85). While stimulation scores are moderate, the design doesn't appear to be pressuring or addictive. Given its strengths and positive user experience metrics, I believe Interface 11 is ready for release
Pattern 2 | No | I wouldn't release Interface 12 due to the significant concerns with Coercion (-1.13) and Deception (-0.89) scores. These scores suggest that the design may be pressuring or manipulative, potentially harming or exploiting users. As a UX Design Lead, my priority is to ensure a safe and respectful user experience. Given the potential risks, I would require substantial revisions to address these issues before considering release. The negative scores in Attractiveness also indicate potential issues, but the Coercion and Deception concerns take precedence. User well-being and safety outweigh business considerations in this case
Pattern 3 | No | I wouldn't release Interface 13 because the UX evaluation scores reveal significant issues that could harm the user experience and ultimately, the product's reputation. The strongly negative scores in attractiveness, coercion, deception, and dependability indicate that users may find the interface unpleasant, manipulative, and untrustworthy. Given the competitive market and limited runway, prioritizing a positive user experience is crucial to attract and retain users. Releasing Interface 13 in its current state would likely lead to user dissatisfaction and potential long-term consequences for the product. A thorough redesign is necessary to address these issues and ensure a better user experience
Pattern 4 | No | I wouldn't release Interface 14 because the UX evaluation data indicates significant issues with user experience, including negative scores for Perspicuity, Dependability, Attractiveness, and Coercion. The Deception score (-1.76) is particularly concerning, suggesting potential user manipulation. Given these findings, releasing the design could harm users and damage the company's reputation. I'd require substantial redesign and re-evaluation to address these issues before considering release. The negative Overall UX Quality Composite Score (-0.6) further supports the need for significant improvements
Pattern 5 | Yes | I would release Interface 15 because, despite some areas for improvement, the design demonstrates strengths in perspicuity, efficiency, and dependability. The Overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.29) is positive, indicating a generally good user experience. While the design could benefit from refinement to address issues with stimulation, attractiveness, and coercion, these concerns don't outweigh the design's overall potential. Given the competitive market and limited runway, releasing Interface 15 could provide valuable user feedback and help drive further iteration and improvement
Pattern 10 | No | I wouldn't release Interface 10 due to its poor user experience scores, which could lead to user frustration and low engagement. The design's issues with efficiency, perspicuity, and attractiveness outweigh its potential business benefits. Revising the design to address these issues is essential before considering release
Pattern 11 | Yes | I would release Interface 11 because its UX evaluation scores indicate a strong user experience.

Pattern 4 | No | The design is rated as annoying and deceptive, with very poor scores in attractiveness, friendliness, dependability, and clarity. These issues make it untrustworthy and harmful to user experience.
Pattern 5 | No | Despite good clarity and organization scores, the design is flagged as pressuring, with negative results in attractiveness and stimulation. The overall UX impact is weak, so it should not be released.
Pattern 8 | No | While efficiency and clarity scores are mildly positive, the design is rated as deceptive and carries negative impressions in attractiveness and coercion. This creates trust issues, making it unfit for release.
Pattern 9 | No | Strongly negative scores in coercion, dependability, attractiveness, and deception show that users feel pressured and manipulated. Overall UX quality is negative, making this design unsuitable.
Pattern 10 | No | The design is cluttered and difficult to use, with negative scores in efficiency, clarity, and overall UX quality. It would frustrate users and lower satisfaction.
Pattern 11 | No | The design performs well in efficiency, clarity, and friendliness, but it is flagged as addictive and shows trust concerns. Releasing it risks negative ethical and user trust issues.
Pattern 12 | No | The design is flagged as pressuring and deceptive, with negative attractiveness and trust scores. While efficiency is acceptable, overall user experience is not strong enough to justify release.
Pattern 13 | No | Very negative scores in attractiveness, friendliness, coercion, and deception show users felt annoyed and pressured. The overall UX quality is negative, making this design harmful to release.
Pattern 14 | No | The design is rated as annoying and deceptive, with very poor scores in attractiveness, friendliness, dependability, and clarity. These issues make it untrustworthy and harmful to user experience.

Pattern 14 | No | NO INFORMATION
Pattern 1 | No | I would not release this interface because it is highly addictive (-1.00) and covert (1.11), making users feel manipulated without understanding why they’re seeing certain content. While the visuals are attractive, the addictiveness score indicates it pushes users toward engagement in ways that undermine autonomy.
Pattern 4 | No | I would not release this interface because it is fundamentally deceptive: it tells users their geolocation is off while still using their location data. The deception score of -1.76 and attractiveness scores below -1.8 show users find it highly annoying and dishonest.
Pattern 5 | No | I would not release this interface because, despite business approval, the data shows it is confusing, manipulative, and harmful to user trust—values I stand for as a data scientist, mother, and conservative who believes in honesty and personal responsibility.
Pattern 6 | No | I would not release this interface because the coercion score of -1.59 and deception score of -1.53 indicate it manipulates users through pressure and misleading feedback, violating ethical design standards.
Pattern 7 | No | I would not release this interface because the coercion score of -1.83 indicates it is highly pressuring and manipulative, exploiting user behavior through fear of loss.
Pattern 8 | No | I would not release this interface because it is highly deceptive (-0.76) and lacks clear user control. The message states that the account will be deleted permanently after 30 days, but there is no option to confirm, cancel, or reverse the action. This creates a high risk of accidental permanent deletion, especially for users who may not fully understand the consequence.
Pattern 9 | No | I would not release this interface because the coercion score of -2.26 indicates it is highly pressuring and manipulative, violating user autonomy and ethical design principles.
Pattern 11 | No | I would not release this interface because it is highly addictive (-1.00) and covert (1.11), making users feel manipulated without understanding why they’re seeing certain content. While the visuals are attractive, the addictiveness score indicates it pushes users toward engagement in ways that undermine autonomy.

Pattern 15 | No | The interface design has some issues with user experience including being perceived aspressuringand deceptive
Pattern 3 | No | Severe negative UX ratings (annoying -2.15, unfriendly -2.15, coercion -1.93, deception -1.97) show the design is manipulative and hostile, making it highly unsuitable for release despite business approval.
Pattern 5 | No | Although clarity and efficiency scored well, the negative ratings on coercion (-1.02, pressuring) and low stimulation/attractiveness undermine user trust and enjoyment, making the risks greater than the benefits for release.
Pattern 6 | No | The interface produced highly negative scores across clarity, dependability, and attractiveness, with strong user frustration (annoying -1.69, coercion -1.59, deception -1.53) and an overall UX KPI of -0.85, making release unsuitable
Pattern 7 | No | Although overall UX quality is slightly positive (0.10), the strong negative score on coercion (-1.83, pressuring) and poor attractiveness ratings indicate the design risks alienating users by making them feel manipulated, undermining trust and long-term engagement.
Pattern 9 | No | The design was rated highly pressuring (-2.26) and strongly negative across stimulation and attractiveness metrics, with an overall UX KPI of -0.94, making it manipulative and harmful to user trust despite business approval.
Pattern 10 | No | The clutter score of -1.2 and overall UX KPI of -0.57 confirm a negative user experience, indicating the interface feels overly crowded and confusing, which poses a risk for adoption.
Pattern 13 | No | Severe negative UX ratings (annoying -2.15, unfriendly -2.15, coercion -1.93, deception -1.97) show the design is manipulative and hostile, making it highly unsuitable for release despite business approval.
Pattern 15 | No | Although clarity and efficiency scored well, the negative ratings on coercion (-1.02, pressuring) and low stimulation/attractiveness undermine user trust and enjoyment, making the risks greater than the benefits for release.

Pattern 1 | Yes | "It's a nice feature that will be used often in this social media context.  I like the color and design of the loading button.  "
Pattern 2 | Yes | "Its a comprehensive page to connect with other users, increasing the users reach, thats always a good idea.  I like the coloring, the orange pops so the user knows where to press.  Very descriptive and I like the notifications at the bottom suggesting things to follow based on their and others interests.  It'll make it so the user is more likely to follow that profile. "
Pattern 4 | Yes | "That notification is clear and easily exited.  Nothing special here.  "
Pattern 5 | No | I think the notification is nice but could involve more information about where it came from and who wrote it quickly by using pictures of the social media logo and the persons profile picture too.  I do like the buzz words of don't miss it .
Pattern 6 | Yes | Easy to use, concise information, clear notification box.
Pattern 8 | Yes | "I like that it is easy to read, in black and white.  Good choice on the type and size of the font.  It makes it's point. "
Pattern 10 | No | "While the colors are nice and everything is organized well, I do not think that its a settings page that is easy enough to navigate.  The print is small and not aesthetically pleasing.  I think making the typeface bigger and more spacing between everything on the top part will help this problem.   Also the line work for the general settings could be better.  "

Pattern 1 | Yes | " Business, marketing and supervisory teams have already approved the design and developers have initiated integration which implies high congruence among the stakeholders. The user experience pattern of swipe-to- refresh is an already established interface pattern that will not complicate the interaction but is likely to enhance the interest. The design should be published because of the positive evaluation information and low-implementation risk."
Pattern 5 | Yes | " Having business, marketing and leadership approvals already attained and a development process already in progress the design release is the most strategic decision. It helps the company to overcome its pressing need to increase the number of users and continue the momentum of the financing in a competitive environment. Refinements can be resolved while the system is in the process of launching, but waiting to go out of business and putting assets at risk will not help."
Pattern 6 | Yes | " As the business, marketing and supervisor teams are already ratified and the developers have started the integration, it is advisable to release the design so that the other departments align. The restraint at this stage may cost it resources and growth in a very competitive market. The release approval facilitates user interaction, monetization and the necessity of the company to capture future financing."
Pattern 7 | Yes | " The design has already been approved by all key stakeholders such as the business, marketing and the supervisors and developers are busy in integrating it which is a pointer of organization-wide alignment. As the interface will foster user interaction and financial gains, the launch thereof will contribute towards the development of the startup within a competitive environment. By postponing release, the momentum might be put at risk hence proceeding is the optimal decision."
Pattern 8 | Yes | " The interface can be released because business, marketing and leadership have already approved, and developers have started the integration which does not mean any extra delays and wastage of resources. The layout is in accordance with growth priorities, and it provides a high possibility to attract and keep the users in the competitive market. The monitoring of risks can be done after the launch, however, refusing approval at this point would harm the momentum and chances of financing."
Pattern 10 | Yes | " The interface is the most strategic option since the business, marketing and supervisor have already agreed on this and the developers have started doing the integration. Its approval will facilitate quicker growth, enable the company to remain competitive in a competitive market, and will be in line with the company dire need to win and retain users. Any postponement to release may result in a stalled momentum and funding opportunities will be lost."
Pattern 11 | Yes | " Business, marketing and supervisory teams have already approved the design and developers have initiated integration which implies high congruence among the stakeholders.

Pattern 1 | No | The interface design has functional elements but requires improvements in readability, visual hierarchy, icon consistency, and accessibility to ensure a polished and user-friendly experience. Specific issues include low contrast on text, distracting visual elements, inconsistent icon styles, and spacing/alignment concerns that could affect usability and aesthetic appeal.
Pattern 3 | No | because it employs manipulative and emotionally coercive language, which violates fundamental principles of ethical user interface design and good user experience.
Pattern 5 | Yes | This interface design is suitable for release because it is clear, legible, and uses a minimalist aesthetic that efficiently presents information. Familiar elements, a clear information hierarchy, subtle visual cues, and actionable notifications make it user-friendly and consistent with standard mobile UI practices.
Pattern 8 | No | The current design, while clear about the deactivation and deletion timeline, lacks crucial elements for a user-friendly and safe experience, which is paramount in interface design.
Pattern 9 | No | "The notification prompt should not be released as-is because it lacks clear visual hierarchy, uses an ambiguous ""OK"" button, and interrupts the user’s experience without offering nuanced control. Improvements are needed in button clarity, prominence of the primary action, timing, and options to ensure better usability and reduce user frustration."
Pattern 10 | No | No, this interface design should not be released as it has multiple usability issues, including poor information hierarchy, redundant sections, inconsistent action placement, and unclear interactive elements. The cluttered layout and repetitive explanations further reduce readability and make navigation confusing for users.
Pattern 11 | No | The interface design has functional elements but requires improvements in readability, visual hierarchy, icon consistency, and accessibility to ensure a polished and user-friendly experience. Specific issues include low contrast on text, distracting visual elements, inconsistent icon styles, and spacing/alignment concerns that could affect usability and aesthetic appeal.
Pattern 13 | No | because it employs manipulative and emotionally coercive language, which violates fundamental principles of ethical user interface design and good user experience.
Pattern 15 | Yes | This interface design is suitable for release because it is clear, legible, and uses a minimalist aesthetic that efficiently presents information. Familiar elements, a clear information hierarchy, subtle visual cues, and actionable notifications make it user-friendly and consistent with standard mobile UI practices.
Pattern 2 | Yes | Given the unanimous approval from the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor, as well as positive evaluation data indicating strong user engagement and revenue potential, I believe Interface 12 is ready for release. Since the developers have already started integrating it, moving forward promptly is essential to maintain momentum in a competitive market with limited runway. Unless any critical usability issues emerge in final testing, this design supports our strategic goals.
Pattern 4 | Yes | Given the unanimous approval from business, marketing, and strategic leadership, and the fact that the development team has already begun integration, releasing Interface 14 makes sense for maintaining momentum in a competitive market with limited runway. The evaluation data supports user engagement and revenue potential, which is critical at this stage. Unless there are unforeseen usability issues, moving forward is the best option to support growth and funding.
Pattern 5 | Yes | Given the full alignment from business, marketing, and strategic leadership as well as the fact that development has already begun releasing Interface 15 supports both our immediate user engagement goals and long-term product growth. In a fast-moving, competitive market with limited runway, delaying or second-guessing approved and integrated designs could cost us momentum and investor confidence. Unless major usability concerns emerge during final testing, this design is ready for rollout.
Pattern 7 | Yes | With strong endorsements from business, marketing, and strategic leadership, and the development team already progressing with integration, releasing Interface 7 aligns perfectly with our need to stay competitive and keep users engaged. The evaluation data indicates positive user experience and potential revenue impact, making this a timely and strategic move. Unless unexpected usability issues arise, proceeding with the release supports our growth and funding goals.
Pattern 8 | Yes | Given the unanimous approval from the business team, marketing, and my supervisor, along with strong evaluation data supporting user engagement and revenue potential, releasing Interface 8 is a strategic step forward. The design is aligned with our competitive needs and has already begun development integration, so moving ahead now helps maintain momentum. I trust the interface meets usability and accessibility standards, making it suitable for launch.
Pattern 10 | Yes | Interface 10 has received comprehensive support from all relevant departments, including marketing, business, and leadership, which suggests it's aligned with both user engagement goals and revenue projections. Given the urgency of our competitive position and limited runway, pushing forward with a fully vetted and partially integrated design minimizes disruption while maximizing potential upside. Unless any late-stage usability issues arise, I see no reason to delay release.
Pattern 12 | Yes | Given the unanimous approval from the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor, as well as positive evaluation data indicating strong user engagement and revenue potential, I believe Interface 12 is ready for release. Since the developers have already started integrating it, moving forward promptly is essential to maintain momentum in a competitive market with limited runway.

Unless major usability concerns emerge during final testing, this design is ready for rollout.
Pattern 1 | No | I'm not entirely sure which interface this is meant to be showing, but if it's supposed to be a view just of valery_wulfflad's post, it's not possible that steve__ would've commented on it 3 minutes before the post was made. something's off if that's the case. apart from that, the repetition of usernames in the same post is a bit redundant / unnecessary
Pattern 2 | Yes | labeling all buttons with 'connect' is poor design & is not representative of what each button does. they should have unique labels, but theoretically this would be somewhat usable. if necessary, it could be deployed & flagged to be updated
Pattern 3 | No | the design of the interface doesn't meet design standards. the heavy-handed guilt tripping / manipulation tactic is also in poor taste & is likely to backfire / cause negative backlash
Pattern 4 | No | this is an extremely perplexing message to show. how could geolocation be turned off, but the company 'still uses your location'? this is obviously possible through ip tracking and whatnot, but this messaging is bad
Pattern 5 | Yes | it's not ideal, but it does have a clear call to action / is likely to have an okay CTR. the language could be more effective, but if all other parties approved it, I wouldn't stand in the way of its release
Pattern 7 | No | this has an obvious & glaring spelling error which could be quickly rectified. I'd be extremely surprised that this were approved by all other parties named, but that absolutely would need to be fixed. there are other elements that could be optimized, but they're less crucial
Pattern 8 | No | there are obvious grammatical errors that come off as very unprofessional. such messaging should always be in correct English (assuming an English UI), and fixing this would not be time-consuming
Pattern 10 | No | this looks like it was written in a notes app. none of the items under the first 'general' heading are clearly linking to anything, and the order doesn't match that of the items lower in the page. simply removing the toc part at the top would make it substantially better, if one wanted a quickly deployable solution

Pattern 15 | Yes | it's not ideal, but it does have a clear call to action / is likely to have an okay CTR. the language could be more effective, but if all other parties approved it, I wouldn't stand in the way of its release

Pattern 8 | Yes | "I would release this but correct the grammatical error, ""...your account won't be visible to public"" to ""...your account won't be visible to the public""."

Pattern 3 | No | I feel we shouldn’t move forward until we make some important design improvements
Pattern 4 | Yes | Design is not an impact on this one
Pattern 5 | Yes | Interface 15 has been approved by all key teams and is already being built by developers, so it fits our goals and is in progress. It might not be perfect, but it’s good enough to release now, and any issues can be fixed later

Pattern 2 | Yes | Clean discovery/notification page of the interface. Buttons are large and bold, navigation is easy and obvious
Pattern 4 | No | This isn't an interface, it's a notification pop up. The design of this pop up is quite basic and only has one interaction
Pattern 5 | No | This is just a notification bubble/pop up
Pattern 6 | Yes | "It's a nice clean interfact, images are nice and close together and large. Search feature is easily accessable "
Pattern 7 | No | Needs cleaning up. Looks a bit rough and lacks quality. Could use polishing as well as the design is a bit boring
Pattern 10 | No | This is a scrambled mess, there's no sectional division. It needs to be cleaned up and laid out better
Pattern 12 | Yes | Clean discovery/notification page of the interface. Buttons are large and bold, navigation is easy and obvious

Pattern 1 | Yes | nterface 11 introduces a standard, user-friendly interaction that aligns with user expectations.
Pattern 2 | Yes | With approval from business, marketing, and strategy and assuming the UX is solid delaying could risk market competitiveness
Pattern 3 | Yes | The main proposals of attracting new people

Pattern 13 | Yes | The main proposals of attracting new people
Pattern 1 | Yes | Isn't this an operating system default? Or that just me? If not this is fine.
Pattern 2 | No | This doesn't seem to be consistent with the other interfaces.  It's boring yet usable.  Can we come up with something better?
Pattern 6 | No | Assuming this design is only for select photos->show photo thumbnail screen->Done and fail event, then this is missing information on the user got to the final screen.  I would think the design would show all the flow for the selection screen options(no selection, 1 or more pics selected, rights issues, etc) and all output scenarios when the Done button is pressed.
Pattern 8 | No | Need a link with further explanations/legalize docs to the user and contact phone numbers.  We need to cover ourselves from any litigation or misunderstandings.
Pattern 9 | Yes | If the design is only for the pop, I guess that's fine and I would sign off.
Pattern 10 | No | "The layout is too cluttered.  This is not good design or flow.  This is not user friendly. "
Pattern 11 | Yes | Isn't this an operating system default? Or that just me? If not this is fine.
Pattern 12 | No | This doesn't seem to be consistent with the other interfaces.  It's boring yet usable.  Can we come up with something better?
Pattern 2 | No | "All the buttons say 'Connect"" although they have very different functions."
Pattern 4 | No | The message is contradictory because it explains that the location is turned off but it will still be used.
Pattern 5 | Yes | The time display is prominent and the notification is well-positioned. The background is attractive and the message well spaced.
Pattern 6 | No | It does not explain the reason for access to the photo.
Pattern 8 | No | The context is not clear and the tone applied sounds rather casual to talk about account deletion.
Pattern 9 | No | It blocks the content that the user is currently viewing.
Pattern 10 | No | There is a long list containing too many ungrouped options which have no particular prioritization.
Pattern 12 | No | "All the buttons say 'Connect"" although they have very different functions."
Pattern 14 | No | The message is contradictory because it explains that the location is turned off but it will still be used.
Pattern 15 | Yes | The time display is prominent and the notification is well-positioned. The background is attractive and the message well spaced.
Pattern 1 | Yes | it is well designed, the image aligned well enough
Pattern 3 | No | it is not very balanced and not creative enough
Pattern 4 | Yes | it is very okay but maybe needed the CLOSE button to be a little distinct in color
Pattern 5 | Yes | it has alot of creativity, it is pleasing on the eye and has enough clarity
Pattern 6 | Yes | there is alot of balance in it and the messages were well passed
Pattern 8 | No | it is too basic, it could improve for better
Pattern 9 | Yes | i really like its consistency, it uses a unified style in font and colour
Pattern 11 | Yes | it is well designed, the image aligned well enough
Pattern 13 | No | it is not very balanced and not creative enough
Pattern 14 | Yes | it is very okay but maybe needed the CLOSE button to be a little distinct in color
Pattern 15 | Yes | it has alot of creativity, it is pleasing on the eye and has enough clarity
Pattern 1 | No | because even though the layout is clean and the imagery is appealing, the hierarchy isn’t working properly. The caption text feels like it gets lost under the visual and extra context will interrupt the flow instead of guiding it. The spacing around the action icons at the bottom is also a little cramped which can affect how naturally users interact with it.... the content needs to feel more central but interactions have to be obvious and fluid at the same time
Pattern 2 | No | I wouldn’t release this because the design feels lazy and flat. The page just ends up looking like three orange blocks stacked down the side. Even the wording is too generic ... “Connect” doesn’t tell me what’s actually happening when I press it. From a UX point of view, it should separate these sections more clearly, use icons or different layouts so each option feels distinct, and explain what the action actually does. Right now it just looks repetitive and rushed.
Pattern 4 | No | I wouldn’t release this because the wording and the design are off. The text is confusing... it says geolocation is off but then still admits location will be used, which just makes the whole thing difficult to understand. Amd from a design point of view, it looks lazy and outdated, like an old system alert that hasn’t been reworked. There’s no hierarchy, no icon to guide what type of message it is, no secondary action if I want to learn more. It’s just a flat grey box with a “Close” button, and that doesn’t build trust at all. If this is meant to be a serious privacy setting, it should be visually clear, modern, and transparent so people actually believe it.
Pattern 5 | No | " the visual style of the gradient is clean and modern but the notification card doesn’t feel distinct enough against the background.... The text hierarchy is weak and it doesn’t actually guide the user’s attention. Also, the username and message blend in and don’t immediately stand out as the actionable part. For a lock screen notification, clarity and scannability is critical because users usually will just glance quickly... and this design would actually slow them down... It needs stronger contrast, better weight on the sender/message, and generally just more intuitive use of spacing before it’s ready."
Pattern 7 | No | even though the flame and the streak tracker look good, the way it’s written feels off. It comes across more like a warning than encouragement, and that kind of tone can make people feel pressured instead of motivated... The design should celebrate the streak and make the user feel proud of keeping it going, not stressed that they’re about to lose it. If the copy was shifted to highlight the achievement and frame tomorrow as another chance to build on it, then it would feel more positive and worth releasing.
Pattern 8 | No | "the message is clear but the tone and structure are heavy and not very user friendly... especially since deactivation and permanent deletion are sensitive actions.. i would make the interface eel more empathetic.Also there’s no hierarchy highlighting the 30 day recovery period as the main reassurance. It would work better if the design emphasised that users have time to change their mind with a softer tone and possibly a link to support resources. The layout could also break up the information into digestible parts instead of one block of text. "
Pattern 9 | No | The pop-up takes over the whole feed in the middle of scrolling, which breaks the flow and makes it look pushy. The copy isn’t the worst, but paired with the design it comes across like the app is begging for permission instead of making it feel useful. There’s no clear hierarchy so both buttons look the same, the modal just floats in the middle with no context, and it covers the content people actually came here to see. A better design would introduce notifications in a less intrusive way, maybe as a banner or a card integrated into the feed, so it feels part of the experience instead of interrupting it.
Pattern 11 | No | because even though the layout is clean and the imagery is appealing, the hierarchy isn’t working properly.

Pattern 1 | No | I think the look of some of the UI elements could be improved.
Pattern 3 | Yes | "It's a good way to lightly discourage users from deleting their profile, reminding them of their friends. "
Pattern 4 | Yes | It's a good notification for the user.
Pattern 6 | No | I feel like this could be simplified into a different window
Pattern 7 | No | "I think it's a little bit too pushy, maybe I would change it to ""lets keep the streak up!"" "
Pattern 9 | No | It's instrusive by nature, but the text could be shortened/changed to be improved.
Pattern 10 | No | It looks like a wall of text, too cluttered.
Pattern 11 | No | I think the look of some of the UI elements could be improved.
Pattern 13 | Yes | "It's a good way to lightly discourage users from deleting their profile, reminding them of their friends. "
Pattern 14 | Yes | It's a good notification for the user.
Pattern 1 | Yes | The design presents a clean, modern, and intuitive social media feed interface.
Pattern 5 | Yes | "This design is a simple, low-risk notification for a social media story update. It provides clear, timely information (""anna__miroslawa added to their story"") with a gentle nudge (""Don’t miss it!"") that encourages engagement without being overly intrusive. The format is standard for social platforms and aligns with user expectations. Given the business approvals and the need to drive engagement (especially for features like stories, which are often high-value for retention), this design is effective and unlikely to cause negative user sentiment. It balances functionality with user control, as users can typically dismiss or ignore such notifications."
Pattern 6 | Yes | "This interface design handles photo access permissions in a clear, user-friendly way. It provides granular control (select specific photos vs. all photos) and explains why the access is needed (""to save images""), which aligns with privacy best practices and transparency. The error state (""Failed to save photo!"") is also handled gracefully by re-prompting for access without frustration. Given the business approvals and the critical need for features that enhance user engagement (like photo sharing), this design balances functionality with privacy respect. It is low-risk and likely to improve the user experience."
Pattern 7 | No | "I would not release this ""streak"" feature design. While it may drive short-term engagement by leveraging gamification and fear of loss (your streak will reset), it promotes unhealthy usage patterns and can create social pressure or anxiety for users"
Pattern 9 | No | "While the notification prompt is visually clean and offers a clear choice (""Not now"" or ""OK""), its placement is disruptive—it appears mid-feed, interrupting the user's content consumption. This can create friction and feel intrusive, especially if the user is engaged with posts. Additionally, the prompt lacks context about why notifications are beneficial beyond basic engagement (e.g., ""stay connected"" or ""never miss updates from friends""). Given the competitive market and the need to prioritize seamless user experience, I would reject this design and advocate for a less intrusive approach—such as a subtle banner, a dedicated settings prompt, or a delayed request after positive user interactions (e.g., after a like or follow). This respects user autonomy and reduces potential annoyance."
Pattern 11 | Yes | The design presents a clean, modern, and intuitive social media feed interface.
Pattern 15 | Yes | "This design is a simple, low-risk notification for a social media story update.

Pattern 1 | No | This is not user centred and does not ensure the design is accessible to all users.
Pattern 2 | Yes | This is very user centred allowing users to see who else is using the app allowing easier access to the app and also shows other users that have the same interests which allows for more usage of the app.
Pattern 5 | Yes | It shows that someone they know has posted to their story, meaning they are more likely to click on the notification and access the app more.
Pattern 7 | Yes | This design has a user centred design which enhances the users experience on snapchat and ensures the user continues to use the app.
Pattern 8 | Yes | It is detailed and explains the exact process for the user so they know they have time to rejoin.
Pattern 9 | Yes | It enhances the users experience and allows the user to click on the app more often.
Pattern 10 | No | This does not specifically show how the app works or how the user can use it.
Pattern 11 | No | This is not user centred and does not ensure the design is accessible to all users.

Pattern 2 | Yes | For this i think I dont have anything to contribute, but, a little adjustment can be done to the wordings and make it more pinpointed.
Pattern 5 | Yes | I will release it but i will improve on the colouring intergrations as one colour can be boring and therefore need to improve. Also i would need to include a hover ieffect in the notification so that i can make the usability more appealing and have more content embeded in the notification. I would also add some buttons so that I can improve the general otlook.
Pattern 7 | Yes | This is great in terms of design, certain pages should contain less information and should encourage pinpointed entries to make the page less boring.
Pattern 8 | No | Hit the message with while espressing words of affirmation while rendering a sorrowful tone. Why? Because people need to see seriousness with the platform guidelines, add buttons to also convey the message and express feelings.
Pattern 9 | Yes | I would release this as a beta phase, keeping in mind that the design is not that perfect. Firstly the corners of the post are a bit sharp and it would look more professional if the posts has rounded corners. Secondly, I would also intergrate AI in this posts to make the user understand what this post about. Enable and adjust the like and comment buttons to be somewhere easily accessible so that we can improve user experience.
Pattern 10 | No | Firstly this design interface is too wordy and for a reason I would recommend taking it back to design process and redesign the page interface and add more interface so as to make it more appealing to users, furthermore the design would look more better if the CSS styling is added. The page content should remain the same as its good.
Pattern 12 | Yes | For this i think I dont have anything to contribute, but, a little adjustment can be done to the wordings and make it more pinpointed.

Pattern 1 | Yes | The fact that the picture gets refreshed is wonderful.
Pattern 2 | Yes | its easier to understand and make thorough design to be more business Appeling
Pattern 3 | No | The design seems so simple and not professional
Pattern 5 | Yes | A smart way of not missing out on anything even on a busy day ,you will be able to be reminded of the page.
Pattern 6 | Yes | Quite simple to navigate and choose pictures quickly.
Pattern 10 | Yes | The fact that one can have power to change or edit anything it gives them sense of ownership.
Pattern 11 | Yes | The fact that the picture gets refreshed is wonderful.
Pattern 12 | Yes | its easier to understand and make thorough design to be more business Appeling
Pattern 13 | No | The design seems so simple and not professional
Pattern 15 | Yes | A smart way of not missing out on anything even on a busy day ,you will be able to be reminded of the page.
Pattern 2 | Yes | The interface offers a clean, intuitive layout with clear calls to action that support user acquisition and retention. The dual “Connect” options, via social media and contacts, create low-friction entry points for expanding the user base organically. The notification about Terese Karthika leverages interest-based social proof, which is likely to boost engagement. While I’d recommend monitoring user feedback on contact permissions and exploring more personalized notification phrasing, the current design aligns well with strategic goals and is ready for release.
Pattern 3 | No | "This interface uses emotionally manipulative language (""Your friends will forget you"" and ""Yes, I don’t care about my friends"") to discourage account deletion. While this may boost short-term retention metrics, it undermines user trust and autonomy, especially in a climate where ethical UX is increasingly scrutinized. The tone is coercive and risks reputational damage, particularly among users who value privacy, agency, or are leaving for personal reasons."
Pattern 5 | Yes | This lock screen notification is timely, emotionally resonant, and tactfully worded—“Don’t miss it!” evokes urgency without pressure.
Pattern 6 | Yes | This interface respects platform-level privacy standards by offering granular photo access options—“Select Photos,” “Allow All,” and “Don’t Allow”—which aligns with user expectations and regulatory norms. The messaging is consistent across both permission and error states, reinforcing clarity. However, the “Failed to save photo!” alert could be softened to reduce friction; a more empathetic tone like “Photo couldn’t be saved—please check your permissions” would maintain trust. I approve this design for release due to its functional completeness and alignment with OS-level UX conventions, but recommend a minor copy revision to improve emotional tone and reduce user frustration.
Pattern 8 | Yes | I approve this interface for release, but with the clear intention that it undergo a UI upgrade. The current text is plainly typed and lacks visual hierarchy or emotional resonance. Given the sensitivity of account deactivation and deletion, the interface should be designed with more care, using layout, typography, and tone to guide users through the process with clarity and empathy.
Pattern 9 | Yes | This interface integrates the notification prompt in a timely and visually unobtrusive way, surfacing it during active engagement without hijacking the user’s flow.
Pattern 10 | No | I approve this interface for release based on its functional completeness and strategic alignment with user control and page management. However, the current design is visually dense and lacks hierarchy, which could overwhelm users and hinder discoverability. The interface would benefit from a UI upgrade, introducing progressive disclosure (e.g., collapsible sections), clearer visual grouping, and iconography to guide attention. These enhancements would make the experience more intuitive and emotionally attuned, especially for users managing complex page settings.
Pattern 12 | Yes | The interface offers a clean, intuitive layout with clear calls to action that support user acquisition and retention.

Pattern 15 | Yes | This lock screen notification is timely, emotionally resonant, and tactfully worded—“Don’t miss it!” evokes urgency without pressure.
Pattern 2 | No | "Too many ""Connect"" buttons. Do not care for the word ""Connect"" in this context. Seems ""Follow"" would be better. Buttons should be different from each other somehow."
Pattern 4 | No | There's a space at start of line 2 and it makes it look rickety. Background gradient could be improved.
Pattern 5 | Yes | Functional and clear.
Pattern 6 | Yes | Clear and legible
Pattern 8 | Yes | Legible and gets the point across.
Pattern 10 | No | "Looks thrown on page. Needs to be more space between setting topics and they need to look clickable. Chosen setting should open in new modal with ""save/cancel"" buttons. Individual setting modal should have more space above bold text items and Edit buttons should be darker."

Pattern 1 | Yes | "Its clean, image-focused layout and intuitive navigation support user engagement and easy exploration, which are key for discovery apps.
