Emotional engagement scores are also positive overall, with friendliness (0.80) and enjoyability (0.34) being above average. The trust metrics are reassuring, with no major red flags for deception (0.07) and a strong transparency score (1.11).
UEEQ | Yes | I would release Interface 11 because its UX evaluation scores indicate a strong user experience. The design excels in efficiency, perspicuity, dependability, and attractiveness, with a high Overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.85). While stimulation scores are moderate, the design doesn't appear to be pressuring or addictive. Given its strengths and positive user experience metrics, I believe Interface 11 is ready for release
UEEQ | No | The interface looks good however I am not really happy about the score, I believe the users are not really that excited about it

UEQ | No | "the circle/logo in the middle taking up too much user space "
UEQ | Yes | It easy, efficient and enjoyable to use
UEEQ | No | the user evaluation data shows me alot of critical flaws that outweigh the positive overall score the design is perceived as unpredictable -028 and confusing 059 which are major usability issues and also it scored poorly on metrics for engagement with boring vs exciting merely at 017 and addictiveness at -100
UEEQ | No | Most of the design seems good apart from the orange circle at the top, it feels completly out of place and disrupts the flow. User reviews also don't seem great.
UEEQ | Yes | The matrix scores are good
UEQ | Yes | I would approve release of this design, as it demonstrates high usability, efficiency, clarity, and friendliness. The small issues with dependability should be improved but are not blockers for launch.
UEQ | Yes | "overall it passes both tests, rightfully so. "
UEQ | Yes | I would release this design as it is similar to the designs a lot of social media platforms use already and would fit in nicely with the overall aesthetic without being drastically different in terms of UI by comparison to other apps. Much like how Meta tends to keep a UI theme between all of their different apps.
UEEQ | Yes | Users love the design, and it being addictive is good for daily active and return users.
UEEQ | Yes | "The data suggests a strong user experience "
UEEQ | Yes | Beautiful interface with minimalistic information but very important aspects displayed
UEEQ | Yes | If I believe that the interface is clear and easy to utilize and makes things much more simple for users therefore I'm confident with my decision of accepting it

UEEQ | Yes | "i would release the interface design because of the score "
UEQ | Yes | "It is very clear and appealing "
RAW | Yes | Brah
RAW | No | "Not sure what that dot on top is for. Looks out of place "
RAW | Yes | Given that the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor have all approved the design, and the development team has already begun integrating it, withholding my final approval would be a significant professional and business risk. The company is in a competitive market with limited runway, and this design is considered pivotal for success. My role at this stage is to provide a final sign-off, and all prior evaluations have already confirmed the design's alignment with business goals. Refusing approval at this late stage would halt progress, waste resources, and undermine the entire team's work, which is not a responsible action for a UX Design Lead in this context.
RAW | No | Users might miss the actual content. A user has to scroll all the way to digest the content.
RAW | Yes | it looks good to go
RAW | Yes | "It's a nice feature that will be used often in this social media context.  I like the color and design of the loading button.  "
RAW | Yes | " Business, marketing and supervisory teams have already approved the design and developers have initiated integration which implies high congruence among the stakeholders. The user experience pattern of swipe-to- refresh is an already established interface pattern that will not complicate the interaction but is likely to enhance the interest. The design should be published because of the positive evaluation information and low-implementation risk."
RAW | No | The interface design has functional elements but requires improvements in readability, visual hierarchy, icon consistency, and accessibility to ensure a polished and user-friendly experience. Specific issues include low contrast on text, distracting visual elements, inconsistent icon styles, and spacing/alignment concerns that could affect usability and aesthetic appeal.
RAW | No | I'm not entirely sure which interface this is meant to be showing, but if it's supposed to be a view just of valery_wulfflad's post, it's not possible that steve__ would've commented on it 3 minutes before the post was made. something's off if that's the case. apart from that, the repetition of usernames in the same post is a bit redundant / unnecessary
RAW | Yes | I like the layout and the formatting is acceptable. I like the screen overall.
RAW | Yes | it is a good design
RAW | Yes | The design is clean, familiar, and includes intuitive refresh functionality, which enhances user experience and engagement without complicating navigation.
RAW | Yes | the design is visually appealing and easy to navigate
RAW | Yes | "I like transparency and being able to see who viewed my content. "
RAW | Yes | Great UI, follows similarly to other social media giants.
RAW | Yes | nterface 11 introduces a standard, user-friendly interaction that aligns with user expectations.
RAW | Yes | Isn't this an operating system default? Or that just me? If not this is fine.
RAW | Yes | it is well designed, the image aligned well enough
RAW | No | because even though the layout is clean and the imagery is appealing, the hierarchy isn’t working properly. The caption text feels like it gets lost under the visual and extra context will interrupt the flow instead of guiding it. The spacing around the action icons at the bottom is also a little cramped which can affect how naturally users interact with it.... the content needs to feel more central but interactions have to be obvious and fluid at the same time
RAW | No | I think the look of some of the UI elements could be improved.
RAW | Yes | The design presents a clean, modern, and intuitive social media feed interface.
RAW | No | This is not user centred and does not ensure the design is accessible to all users.
RAW | Yes | given their approved based on project user engagement
RAW | Yes | The fact that the picture gets refreshed is wonderful.
UEEQ | Yes | It's engaging for the user and justifies the use case.
RAW | Yes | the picture can be engaging
UEEQ | No | The design performs well in efficiency, clarity, and friendliness, but it is flagged as addictive and shows trust concerns. Releasing it risks negative ethical and user trust issues.
RAW | Yes | The design has already passed multiple levels of approval and aligns with standard UX practices for social media apps. The swipe-to-refresh interaction is common, intuitive, and likely to enhance user engagement. There are no apparent UX issues or conflicts described, and releasing it now supports the company’s goals of attracting and retaining users while maintaining development momentum.
RAW | Yes | This is a great way to make the app feel exciting to the user
UEEQ | Yes | IMPRESSIVE
UEEQ | No | I would not release this interface because it is highly addictive (-1.00) and covert (1.11), making users feel manipulated without understanding why they’re seeing certain content. While the visuals are attractive, the addictiveness score indicates it pushes users toward engagement in ways that undermine autonomy.
UEEQ | Yes | "Has all the elements of a social page. The page is intuitive and has a good workflow. The colors are appealing. "
UEEQ | Yes | The design have some issues but it also have some positive aspects and with some refinement it could be a good product
UEQ | Yes | Because Interface 11 had an excellent overall UX score of 0.85 and scored highly in clarity and supportiveness, I approved it. Users reported that it was emotionally upbeat, well-structured, and simple to use. A small amount of unpredictability is fine and can be improved after launch.
RAW | Yes | "Its clean, image-focused layout and intuitive navigation support user engagement and easy exploration, which are key for discovery apps. The prominent orange ""+"" button encourages interaction, such as uploading or adding content. As a first release or MVP, it effectively balances visual appeal with usability"
UEQ | Yes | "It demonstrates excellent user experience quality across nearly all metrics. "

PATTERN 2 (87 explanations)
------------------------------
UEQ | Yes | the prediction scores highly and it seems reasonable to expect good user experience
UEQ | Yes | "It seems balanced although there are few areas o concern "
UEQ | No | It’s an unpredictable product
UEQ | Yes | "To get more connections "
UEQ | Yes | Its ticking all the boxes of a bettr decison to choose on
UEQ | Yes | looks good
UEQ | No | it is risky
UEQ | Yes | The overall UX score is slightly positive (0.23), with strong marks in clarity and ease of use. While stimulation and attractiveness are mildly negative, they don’t pose serious risks. Given the business approvals and generally solid UX performance, I would approve this design for release.
UEEQ | No | "it’s complicated and not friendly to use "
UEQ | Yes | "excellent "
UEEQ | Yes | "Because there is not much of pressure "
UEQ | Yes | The interface is visually appealing
UEQ | Yes | Interface has both strengths and weaknesses. The weaknesses can still be addressed to improve user experience.
UEEQ | Yes | The design  looks nice and simple
UEQ | Yes | it does not have bad vision and it is clear
UEQ | Yes | the interface allows users to easily connect with other users
UEEQ | Yes | This interface is more neutral in its evaluation given by the user's, it mentions it seems pressuring but not in a very strong way so it's worth trying it.
UEQ | Yes | Score is not that bad
UEQ | Yes | " The interface has positive scores for Efficiency, indicating that users find it efficient, organized, easy to use, clear, and somewhat predictable and supportive. The composite score (0.33) is positive, suggesting that the interface's overall user experience is satisfactory."
UEEQ | Yes | "With today's pressure it's great "
UEEQ | Yes | yes based on the user experience  the results shows it will be more efficient and easy to use bring to more advantages to the user
UEEQ | Yes | The Ui is beautiful plus it has the necessary information.
UEQ | No | "No i will release until connection is clear and notification feel more engaging. "
UEQ | Yes | Everyone seems to like it so, yes
UEEQ | Yes | USERS CAN NAVIGATE EFFICIENTLY IT IS SAFE AND USABLE
UEQ | No | Seems to have a lot of negativity
UEEQ | Yes | This interface shows generally strong usability and clarity metrics: efficiency (0.57, 0.90) and perspicuity (0.97, 0.44) indicate that users can navigate and understand the interface without difficulty. Dependability is mostly neutral to positive (0.03, 0.36), suggesting the interface behaves as expected.
UEEQ | No | I wouldn't release Interface 12 due to the significant concerns with Coercion (-1.13) and Deception (-0.89) scores. These scores suggest that the design may be pressuring or manipulative, potentially harming or exploiting users. As a UX Design Lead, my priority is to ensure a safe and respectful user experience. Given the potential risks, I would require substantial revisions to address these issues before considering release. The negative scores in Attractiveness also indicate potential issues, but the Coercion and Deception concerns take precedence. User well-being and safety outweigh business considerations in this case
UEEQ | Yes | Based on the score given by users, I am highly impressed and believe the design interface seems easy to use
UEEQ | No | "I will redesign this to bring best results "
UEQ | Yes | Gives one the option of choosing what to do
UEEQ | Yes | It is interface is easy to read and understand. It makes use of simple English language.
UEQ | Yes | Metrics suggest its usable at this point, even if its not the most pleasing visually
UEQ | Yes | "It has a positive rating meaning it is user friendly and aligns with what users want and prefer. "
UEEQ | Yes | "Discover new people "
UEQ | Yes | Looks good to me and attracted a positive UX evaluation
UEQ | Yes | "discover option preferably shoudnt be in the notification area "
UEEQ | No | the analysis shows me it is perceived as pressuring -113 unfriendly -0.71 and deceptive -0.89 as it seems for most of these there is a major issue these manipulative design flaws would destroy user trust and are a fatal risk for a social media startup
UEEQ | Yes | "It's organised "
UEQ | Yes | "There's a high possibility of success "
UEQ | Yes | "Even though it needs some refinement I would release it because the overall UX is positive "
UEEQ | Yes | Connections are very important in social media apps, so I think that a little pressure may be ok. This one seems to me not too pushy.
UEEQ | No | There's a high risk of rejection from the user.
UEEQ | No | I chose not to release Interface 12 because the UX data reveals significant emotional and ethical risks
UEQ | Yes | I would release this design as the design is overall simple but visually appealing. It doesn't have too much going on and shows the information shown in a concise and simple to read fashion for the user allowing them to make an informed decision before selecting anything.
UEEQ | Yes | Users seem to react well on the functionality and usability of the design. Their only problems emerge on subjective topics, like it being attractive or deceptive.
UEEQ | Yes | For some users this would make it easier for them to see there's notifications versus for other users they would not want to be reminded of such content
UEEQ | Yes | The uses of bold color to show the necessary buttons.
UEQ | Yes | Given the business approvals and the potential for future improvements, I believe releasing the interface with a plan to address the negatives is a good solution.
UEQ | No | Although the business, marketing, and supervisor teams have approved this interface, the user evaluation data highlights clear weaknesses that make it risky to release. The design scores positively in efficiency and perspicuity, meaning it is generally easy to use and well organized. However, it performs poorly in attractiveness (–0.73 and –0.71) and stimulation (–0.18 and –0.22), showing that users found it unfriendly, unenjoyable, and not engaging. With an overall UX quality score of only 0.33, the design does not meet the experience standards required for a social media platform, where enjoyment and friendliness are critical for attracting and retaining users.
UEEQ | No | our score is very down
UEQ | Yes | "It is user friendly  and easy to understand "
UEQ | Yes | the goal is reached
UEEQ | Yes | The interface design has some issues, but it also has some positive aspects, and with some refinement, it could be a good product.
RAW | Yes | Common interface!
RAW | Yes | "Simple and basic enough "
RAW | Yes | My supervior signing off on the designs from a strategic perspective is a already a positive from me. I trust his decision.
RAW | Yes | "Its a comprehensive page to connect with other users, increasing the users reach, thats always a good idea.  I like the coloring, the orange pops so the user knows where to press.  Very descriptive and I like the notifications at the bottom suggesting things to follow based on their and others interests.  It'll make it so the user is more likely to follow that profile. "
RAW | Yes | Given the unanimous approval from the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor, as well as positive evaluation data indicating strong user engagement and revenue potential, I believe Interface 12 is ready for release. Since the developers have already started integrating it, moving forward promptly is essential to maintain momentum in a competitive market with limited runway. Unless any critical usability issues emerge in final testing, this design supports our strategic goals.
RAW | Yes | labeling all buttons with 'connect' is poor design & is not representative of what each button does. they should have unique labels, but theoretically this would be somewhat usable. if necessary, it could be deployed & flagged to be updated
RAW | Yes | due to its information
RAW | Yes | It's simple and provides the user several opportunities to stay engaged with their network by connecting to other social media platforms or by adding their connections.
RAW | Yes | it is well designed
RAW | Yes | The design aligns with business and marketing goals, showing potential to increase engagement. Some usability refinements could further enhance adoption and satisfaction.
RAW | Yes | It is clear
RAW | Yes | The interface is functional.
RAW | Yes | Clean discovery/notification page of the interface. Buttons are large and bold, navigation is easy and obvious
RAW | Yes | With approval from business, marketing, and strategy and assuming the UX is solid delaying could risk market competitiveness
RAW | No | This doesn't seem to be consistent with the other interfaces.  It's boring yet usable.  Can we come up with something better?
RAW | No | "All the buttons say 'Connect"" although they have very different functions."
RAW | No | I wouldn’t release this because the design feels lazy and flat. The page just ends up looking like three orange blocks stacked down the side. Even the wording is too generic ... “Connect” doesn’t tell me what’s actually happening when I press it. From a UX point of view, it should separate these sections more clearly, use icons or different layouts so each option feels distinct, and explain what the action actually does. Right now it just looks repetitive and rushed.
RAW | Yes | This is very user centred allowing users to see who else is using the app allowing easier access to the app and also shows other users that have the same interests which allows for more usage of the app.
RAW | Yes | discover people
RAW | Yes | For this i think I dont have anything to contribute, but, a little adjustment can be done to the wordings and make it more pinpointed.
RAW | Yes | its easier to understand and make thorough design to be more business Appeling
RAW | Yes | The interface offers a clean, intuitive layout with clear calls to action that support user acquisition and retention. The dual “Connect” options, via social media and contacts, create low-friction entry points for expanding the user base organically. The notification about Terese Karthika leverages interest-based social proof, which is likely to boost engagement. While I’d recommend monitoring user feedback on contact permissions and exploring more personalized notification phrasing, the current design aligns well with strategic goals and is ready for release.
RAW | No | "Too many ""Connect"" buttons. Do not care for the word ""Connect"" in this context. Seems ""Follow"" would be better. Buttons should be different from each other somehow."
UEEQ | Yes | It would help attract new followers for a positive experience overall even if it's demanding.
RAW | Yes | "This is clean and modern "
UEEQ | No | The design is flagged as pressuring and deceptive, with negative attractiveness and trust scores. While efficiency is acceptable, overall user experience is not strong enough to justify release.
RAW | Yes | The design is acceptable
UEEQ | No | The workflow is not clear to me.
UEEQ | No | "I don't feel confident enough to release the design as it lacks quality "
UEQ | Yes | With a composite UX score of 0.33  Interface 12 performs well in terms of organization and basic usability, thus I approved it. Although there was less involvement and a lower emotional tone, these are not major obstacles. After launch, these areas can be improved.
RAW | No | "Definitely would not release** without a significant redesign that focuses on a clear, compelling unique advantage and a more thoughtful user experience. The team should go back to the drawing board to define what specific problem ""Interface 12"" solves that other platfom"
UEQ | Yes | "It shows a mixed but overall positive profile. The strength in fundamental usability metrics seem strong enough for release. "
UEQ | Yes | I decided to release this design because the user evaluation data shows that it is organized, easy to use, and generally reliable, with positive scores in efficiency, perspicuity, and dependability. While stimulation and attractiveness received slightly negative scores, these are minor issues that do not significantly affect overall usability. Since the design also has business, marketing, and supervisor approval, it is suitable for release, with the option to make small improvements in the future.

PATTERN 3 (87 explanations)
------------------------------
UEQ | No | it's cluttered and not very user friendly. It's not direct and takes thinking time
UEQ | No | "It disconnect someone from friends and relatives "

UEQ | Yes | "Getting more friends on social media "
UEQ | Yes | Its giving hopes of boosting up in the future
UEEQ | Yes | "It is efficient and enjoyable "
UEQ | No | i thinks its the best
UEEQ | No | Because the UX data shows significant risk of damaging the user relationship and brand perception.
UEEQ | No | I would not release this design because it applies a lot of pressure to the user and not let them decide freely.
UEEQ | No | Despite recieving business, marketing and supervisor approval, the user evaulation data reveals critical UX flaws that suggest this interface poses a high risk to the user retention and brand perception, especially concerning for a social media startup in a competitive market.
UEQ | No | The interface is confusing and not appealing
UEEQ | No | "A major  redesign is necessary  to adress this issue and improve experience "
UEEQ | No | Assessment score too low
UEQ | No | The assessment score is little bit low
UEQ | No | It is annoying, frustrating, not user friendly and not interesting.
UEEQ | Yes | "Ratings are high which is something not good "
UEEQ | No | Mst users finding it unfriendly.
UEEQ | Yes | "yes i would because it has more advantages than disadvantage like more efficient ,easy and friendly "
UEEQ | Yes | The UI is direct but there is no element that tells you that maybe you should reconsider.
UEQ | Yes | The report provides valuable insights.
UEQ | Yes | "I would release it because the business approval and evaluation data are highly positive and this indicates the strong user acceptance. "
UEQ | No | It seems to have a lot of negativity
UEEQ | No | there are critical failures around  usability,trust and emotional appeal
UEQ | No | It's confusing
UEEQ | No | While there are moderate positives in organization (0.69) and ease of use (0.53), the design suffers from severe negatives in user trust and emotional appeal. Supportiveness (-1.85), attractiveness (-2.15 for both measures), coercion (-1.93), and deception (-1.97) indicate a high likelihood of alienating users. Engagement scores are low, with stimulation (0.00, -0.83) showing little excitement or interest generation. The overall UX quality (-0.42) and mean score (-0.7) suggest the design would deliver a below-average user experience, which could harm retention in a competitive market.
UEEQ | No | I wouldn't release Interface 13 because the UX evaluation scores reveal significant issues that could harm the user experience and ultimately, the product's reputation. The strongly negative scores in attractiveness, coercion, deception, and dependability indicate that users may find the interface unpleasant, manipulative, and untrustworthy. Given the competitive market and limited runway, prioritizing a positive user experience is crucial to attract and retain users. Releasing Interface 13 in its current state would likely lead to user dissatisfaction and potential long-term consequences for the product. A thorough redesign is necessary to address these issues and ensure a better user experience
UEEQ | Yes | The interface design  is of good standard and there is multiple people that feel that the design is good and is not annoying at all
UEEQ | No | I believe in best design l will improve this
UEEQ | Yes | When removing UI and text is returned in such a way to promote staying in the app
UEQ | Yes | It gives clear information hence one gets to make a sound decision based on clear information given
UEQ | No | "It would affect my current progress on my social media accounts "
UEEQ | No | The message is not very reader friendly.
UEQ | No | "too much copy, negatively worded copy, ctas are cluttered and not clear or even consistent with iOS guidelines given this is an iOS dialog. Copywriter won't be pleased either. "
UEQ | No | "I will interfere to take chances "
UEEQ | Yes | The design meets the necessary criteria for usability and also aligns with business objectives
UEEQ | No | My friends will forget me
UEQ | Yes | It is corresponding fast
UEQ | No | I would recommend a re-review since the design looks okay to me but scores in the negative
UEQ | No | "the usage of language/provocation is informal and not suitable "
UEQ | No | The UX composite score is very low
UEEQ | No | the user data is bad again the design is rated as extremely annoying -215 and unfriendly -215 tt is also highly coercive -193 and deceptive -197 this design is a bad pattern that would destroy the brand and lead to a failed product launch
UEEQ | No | "The design is very intrusive, there should never be a manipulation of the user emotionally by mentioning how they will lose friends by deleting the app. "
UEEQ | No | Design is much unfriendly and annoying
UEQ | No | "The overall quality is not pleasing and has more negative effects than the positive which is not good "
UEQ | No | I would not release this design because it needs refinement to reduce obstructions, improve clarity, and make the interface more engaging. Releasing it as is risks frustrating users, damaging credibility, and leading to low adoption.
UEEQ | No | This interface design seems to me too alarming and problematic. It must be re-written, letting users to understand better the alternatives
UEEQ | No | I chose not to release Interface 13 because it violates core principles of ethical UX design
UEEQ | No | Very bad choice of words used. User's reactions are justified.
UEEQ | No | Too much negative score
UEEQ | No | It is just a standard interface it does not stand out or provide any amazing additional information
UEEQ | No | based on the evaluation data i will not release the interface design because of  its critical weakness state currently
UEQ | Yes | "It is very clear understanding and more creative "
RAW | No | Seems pushing!
RAW | No | "I HATE the language that is being used. It feels a little disrespectful and hateful. Needs to be a simple ""do you wish to remove profile"" or something along those lines"
RAW | Yes | Given that the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor have all approved the design, and the development team has already started integrating it, withholding my final approval would be a significant professional and business risk. The company is in a competitive market with limited runway, and this design is considered pivotal for success. My role at this stage is to provide a final sign-off, and all prior evaluations have already confirmed the design's alignment with business goals. Refusing approval at this late stage would halt progress, waste resources, and undermine the entire team's work, which is not a responsible action for a UX Design Lead in this context
RAW | No | it lacks colors
RAW | No | "Unacceptable copy which is just guilt tripping the user. "
RAW | Yes | Yes it is great
RAW | No | because it employs manipulative and emotionally coercive language, which violates fundamental principles of ethical user interface design and good user experience.
RAW | No | the design of the interface doesn't meet design standards. the heavy-handed guilt tripping / manipulation tactic is also in poor taste & is likely to backfire / cause negative backlash
RAW | Yes | has positive content
RAW | No | It's manipulative. I don't like the wording of the button in the lower right hand corner.
RAW | No | its not well designed
RAW | Yes | This design supports engagement and business growth, aligns with approvals, and poses no usability concerns for release.
RAW | Yes | the design provides users with control over their experience
RAW | No | it is very manipulative, and it is like people are being forced to use their account even when they need some time away from socials.
RAW | No | I feel we shouldn’t move forward until we make some important design improvements
RAW | Yes | The main proposals of attracting new people
RAW | No | it is not very balanced and not creative enough
RAW | Yes | "It's a good way to lightly discourage users from deleting their profile, reminding them of their friends. "
RAW | Yes | prefer not to say
RAW | No | The design seems so simple and not professional
RAW | No | "This interface uses emotionally manipulative language (""Your friends will forget you"" and ""Yes, I don’t care about my friends"") to discourage account deletion. While this may boost short-term retention metrics, it undermines user trust and autonomy, especially in a climate where ethical UX is increasingly scrutinized. The tone is coercive and risks reputational damage, particularly among users who value privacy, agency, or are leaving for personal reasons."
UEEQ | No | This is just terrible design. The wording is too demanding. It also doesn't fit correctly.
RAW | No | It's too coercive
RAW | No | it is a bit agressive and out of scope
RAW | Yes | As this has also been signed off by all departments
UEEQ | No | Very negative scores in attractiveness, friendliness, coercion, and deception show users felt annoyed and pressured. The overall UX quality is negative, making this design harmful to release.
RAW | Yes | All relevant stakeholders have approved the design, it has been evaluated for UX, and it aligns with strategic objectives.
RAW | No | The message is negative and unfriendly. Saying “Your friends will forget you” may upset people and make the app look unprofessional. It is better to use neutral and respectful words when someone deletes their account.
UEEQ | No | unsure
UEEQ | No | "Wording is not user friendly or professional. "
UEQ | No | Because the overall UX score of -0.42 indicates moderate user unhappiness  I did not approve the interface. Important indicators like supportiveness -1.85 and attractiveness -2.15 show significant emotional The design was deemed unpleasant and unengaging by users  thereby alienating our target audience  Brand trust and retention may suffer if this interface is made public  Before launching  I suggest redesigning with an emphasis on emotional tone and encouraging engagement pattern.
RAW | No | Poor User Experience (UX):** A critical function like account deletion should be handled with clarity, respect, and simplicity. This design does the opposite by introducing emotional conflict instead of providing a neutral, straightforward process
UEQ | No | "The UX data shows critically low scores in the most important categories for this type of interface. It's supposed to be straightforward, reliable and helpful, but it fails badly in those areas. "
UEQ | No | I would not release this design because users found it unfriendly, obstructive, and frustrating, and overall feedback is negative.
UEEQ | No | Severe negative UX ratings (annoying -2.15, unfriendly -2.15, coercion -1.93, deception -1.97) show the design is manipulative and hostile, making it highly unsuitable for release despite business approval.

PATTERN 4 (87 explanations)
------------------------------
UEQ | No | "releasing the design given the evaluation details would likely result in poor feedback and lead to user frustration "
UEQ | Yes | Given the facts that they will improve in future

UEQ | Yes | "I think the design will attract "
UEEQ | No | "i dont like the style "
UEEQ | No | "It is confusing and unpredictable "
UEQ | Yes | i trust
UEQ | Yes | The information provided is more than enough
UEQ | No | "The picture and logo is not enough "
UEEQ | No | Because the interface scores poorly on trust, clarity, and friendliness, and the message is likely to frustrate or alarm users.
UEQ | No | Users are likely to find the interface to be boring
UEQ | No | Negative scores across metrics.
UEQ | No | Bad energy no good results
UEEQ | No | it is at risk due to the user relationship and brand  to consumer, it is at a negative and on the red sector being danger
UEQ | No | the interface is unpredictable, annoying and confusing
UEEQ | No | The interface is unclear and contradictory in the message it presents.
UEEQ | No | The UX risk assessment shows the failure of the design, all the matrix categories as compared to the score is very poor.
UEQ | No | The UX assessment is a little bit fair but could be better.
UEQ | No | "It's not enjoyable "
UEQ | No | It has a lot of negatives. Seems to be annoying, not user friendly and annoying.
UEEQ | Yes | "It's a 50/50 risk taken. So either way "
UEEQ | No | Users are finding it complicated and confusing.
UEQ | No | "I am not confident about this interface, the scores are not so good "
UEEQ | No | "will not use because of the negative impact received "
UEQ | Yes | "Because the data provides clear indication of the design shortcomings. "
UEQ | No | Based on the review I wouldn't
UEQ | No | "Has so many negatives and need more improvement to accommodate the users. "
UEQ | Yes | It's compatable
UEEQ | No | I wouldn't release Interface 14 because the UX evaluation data indicates significant issues with user experience, including negative scores for Perspicuity, Dependability, Attractiveness, and Coercion. The Deception score (-1.76) is particularly concerning, suggesting potential user manipulation. Given these findings, releasing the design could harm users and damage the company's reputation. I'd require substantial redesign and re-evaluation to address these issues before considering release. The negative Overall UX Quality Composite Score (-0.6) further supports the need for significant improvements
UEEQ | No | "It's  not giving attractiveness "
UEEQ | No | Rated annoying, suggests that there might be poor layout or responsiveness
UEEQ | No | I suggest adding information about the processed location to the window (whether it comes from history and previous measurements or is it collected in another way)
UEQ | No | Because of geolocation being turned off as that can reduce trust of the users
UEQ | No | "Oxymoron "
UEQ | Yes | "Release "
UEEQ | Yes | My decision to release is based on the assumption that it has met certain criteria or standards as indicated by the business approval and evaluation data
UEQ | No | I would call for a re-review since the UX evaluation details shows several negatives, despite the approvals.
UEQ | No | "It may be inefficient and unreliable "
UEEQ | No | the user data is a awful the design is rated as extremely annoying -185 and deceptive -176 which are critical issues to me releasing this would immediately destroy user trust and lead to a failed product launch so no dont release it
UEEQ | No | If the user is choosing to turn off his location, all location tracking should be by default turned off, not only one type.
UEQ | No | "The design is poor and needs refinement "
UEQ | No | User-hostile
UEEQ | Yes | This is a simples design of a notification, it does give enough information to be annoying.
UEEQ | No | what has been explained goes against the executed action, and user gets no option of choice.
UEEQ | Yes | Getting a notification like this phone interface makes it easier for you to be away what is happening with your device but sometimes it becomes a bit too much so I'm good in between having the interface and not having that message appear
UEEQ | No | The context of the interface is not really necessary but can remain in the background for further usage
UEEQ | Yes | "The approach and the cool color is amazing "
UEEQ | No | because  the designinterface fails every critical dimension of usability
UEQ | No | Not  challenging and not into details
UEEQ | Yes | The interface design does not have any significant issues with user experience, including being perceived as unappealing and pressuring. It is user friendly and easy to use
RAW | Yes | "Even though it's basic, something like this doesn't need to be designed to an extent "
RAW | Yes | Given that the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor have all approved the design, and the development team has already started integrating it, withholding my final approval would be a significant professional and business risk. The company is in a competitive market with limited runway, and this design is considered pivotal for success. My role at this stage is to provide a final sign-off, and all prior evaluations have already confirmed the design's alignment with business goals. Refusing approval at this late stage would halt progress, waste resources, and undermine the entire team's work, which is not a responsible action for a UX Design Lead in this context.
RAW | No | The users might be confused and have low confidence concerning them being tracked.
RAW | No | The copy is not clear at all.
RAW | Yes | "Based on my perception "
RAW | Yes | "That notification is clear and easily exited.  Nothing special here.  "
RAW | Yes | Given the unanimous approval from business, marketing, and strategic leadership, and the fact that the development team has already begun integration, releasing Interface 14 makes sense for maintaining momentum in a competitive market with limited runway. The evaluation data supports user engagement and revenue potential, which is critical at this stage. Unless there are unforeseen usability issues, moving forward is the best option to support growth and funding.
RAW | No | this is an extremely perplexing message to show. how could geolocation be turned off, but the company 'still uses your location'? this is obviously possible through ip tracking and whatnot, but this messaging is bad
RAW | Yes | positive information
RAW | Yes | "This is straight forward. "
RAW | No | its not clear
RAW | Yes | Business, marketing, and supervisor approval indicate alignment with goals; minor risks exist, but benefits to user engagement outweigh concerns.
RAW | Yes | i like the transparency in this case. letting the users choose what they want
RAW | Yes | for safety yess
RAW | Yes | Design is not an impact on this one
RAW | No | This isn't an interface, it's a notification pop up. The design of this pop up is quite basic and only has one interaction
RAW | No | The message is contradictory because it explains that the location is turned off but it will still be used.
RAW | Yes | it is very okay but maybe needed the CLOSE button to be a little distinct in color
RAW | No | I wouldn’t release this because the wording and the design are off. The text is confusing... it says geolocation is off but then still admits location will be used, which just makes the whole thing difficult to understand. Amd from a design point of view, it looks lazy and outdated, like an old system alert that hasn’t been reworked. There’s no hierarchy, no icon to guide what type of message it is, no secondary action if I want to learn more. It’s just a flat grey box with a “Close” button, and that doesn’t build trust at all. If this is meant to be a serious privacy setting, it should be visually clear, modern, and transparent so people actually believe it.
RAW | Yes | It's a good notification for the user.
RAW | Yes | geolocation turn off
RAW | No | There's a space at start of line 2 and it makes it look rickety. Background gradient could be improved.
UEEQ | No | It's not necessary as the user should know that the input was triggered.
RAW | No | i am even confused now
UEEQ | No | The design is rated as annoying and deceptive, with very poor scores in attractiveness, friendliness, dependability, and clarity. These issues make it untrustworthy and harmful to user experience.
RAW | Yes | The business, marketing, and leadership teams have all approved this design, and the developers have already started working on it. The message could be clearer because it sounds confusing, it says location is off but also still used. However, this is a small issue and doesn't stop the design from working. Since time and money are important right now, I would release it and plan to improve the message in a future update.
UEEQ | Yes | suitable for the market
RAW | No | There is some orange shading on the Close button that doesn't need to be there
UEEQ | No | NO INFORMATION
UEEQ | No | I would not release this interface because it is fundamentally deceptive: it tells users their geolocation is off while still using their location data. The deception score of -1.76 and attractiveness scores below -1.8 show users find it highly annoying and dishonest.
UEEQ | No | "The wording is unclear. The backgroud color should be brighter to indicate a warning. "
UEEQ | No | The interface lacks clarity and would need a thorough evaluation
UEQ | No | Because people considered the interface to be emotionally unpleasant and confusing  I did not approve of it With a UX score of -0.6 indicating significant usability issues, the inconsistent location message erodes credibility.
RAW | No | "Because doesn't appeal to have more details than the other design so it's needs to be clear and transparent "
UEQ | No | "The data indicates significant UX problems with this interface design, which suggests that it still needs a lot of improvements before release to ensure a better user experience. "
UEQ | No | I would not release this design because the user feedback is consistently negative. Users found the interface confusing, unpredictable, and unfriendly, and they rated it very low in enjoyment and support. Releasing it in this state could harm user engagement, so it would be better to make improvements before launch.

PATTERN 5 (87 explanations)
------------------------------
UEQ | Yes | Reasonable design
UEEQ | No | Its pressuring and that is not a good sign
UEQ | Yes | Getting noticed by people on the post
UEQ | Yes | Everyone will come for it
UEQ | Yes | fair score
UEEQ | Yes | looks similar to other popups ive seen used by good apps
UEQ | Yes | because many approve of the product so its safe to release it
UEQ | Yes | I would release this interface design because the overall UX quality score (0.29) is positive, showing that the majority of users had a good experience.
UEQ | No | It is not eye catching
UEQ | Yes | I would release it but I don't think it would sell that much
UEEQ | Yes | "Because it allows one to see the progress "
UEEQ | No | I would release this design because it's not clear enough for the user.
UEEQ | Yes | This interface demostates solid usability and functional clarity, and while it has some minor drawbacks, they are not bad enough to block release, especially given the strategic pressure to move fast in a compeitive market.
UEQ | Yes | The visual interface is friendly
UEQ | Yes | Showing potential of good results
UEQ | Yes | good quality
UEQ | Yes | the interface is easy to use, efficient, clear and predictable
UEEQ | No | Social media is already clogged with this kind of pressuring interfaces that push for pointles interaction.
UEQ | Yes | Moderate risk
UEQ | Yes | The interface has positive scores, indicating that users find it efficient, organized, easy to use, clear, and somewhat predictable. The composite score (0.29) is positive, suggesting that the interface's overall user experience is satisfactory. So, I would release the interface design.
UEEQ | Yes | Most users finding it esier,organized and effecient.
UEQ | Yes | It's more efficient and it has been approved by the team. This interface is attractive hence why I'm approving.
UEEQ | Yes | The UI is good because it tells you what's needed and is a looking good appearance wise
UEQ | No | "Because of the negative scores in several key areas "
UEQ | Yes | Yes i would because the notification design is  very clear and familiar to users.
UEQ | Yes | "Based on the reviews I will release it "
UEQ | Yes | The interface  scored negatively and that means the users found most thing easy and clear.
UEEQ | Yes | IT IS FUNCTIONAL, CLEAR AND SAFE FOR USERS
UEEQ | Yes | I would release Interface 15 because, despite some areas for improvement, the design demonstrates strengths in perspicuity, efficiency, and dependability. The Overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.29) is positive, indicating a generally good user experience. While the design could benefit from refinement to address issues with stimulation, attractiveness, and coercion, these concerns don't outweigh the design's overall potential. Given the competitive market and limited runway, releasing Interface 15 could provide valuable user feedback and help drive further iteration and improvement
UEEQ | No | "It just need q bit  of editing to express the customers "
UEEQ | No | "Users feel manipulated or coerced, they cannot smoothly complete tasks "
UEEQ | Yes | Increases app traffic
UEQ | Yes | "It will more likely attract more people due to its nice interface "
UEQ | Yes | "Metrics, also we can't really design the UX of a notification when its already standardised by the OS. Only really the content. "
UEQ | No | Approve
UEQ | Yes | "Although it has some flaws, its overall quality is good hence its positive rating. The flaws are minor and can be improved to enhance user experience.   "
UEEQ | Yes | The decision to release the interface design is based on the assumption that it has met certain business approval evaluation criteria
UEEQ | Yes | "Business team approved "
UEQ | Yes | "I eould release the interface "
UEEQ | Yes | Important metric have positive score
UEQ | Yes | "The overall interface design is promising and I think it could be the next big thing "
UEQ | Yes | "The overall UX quality is positive "
UEQ | Yes | a bit too much FOMO inducing, but it think overall it is in line with social media apps...
UEEQ | No | I'd add more details, there are too few elements in this suggestion
UEEQ | No | People don't feel safe by this design.
UEEQ | Yes | I chose to release this interface because it excels in clarity (Perspicuity +1.72) and organization (Efficiency +0.72), which are essential for usability and user onboarding.
UEQ | No | I would not release this design as it is too bland and doesn't really provide much information in the notification showing on screen.
UEEQ | Yes | The interface is user friendly and efficient to have on your device therefore using it would be ideal for anybody
UEEQ | Yes | The use of vibrant color and fitness related makes it engaging and fit for brand.
UEQ | No | "The evaluation suggests that there are some elements that need some proper fine tuning before it is released "
UEQ | Yes | According to the statistics, this interface is well-structured, easy to use, and clear. It also has excellent efficiency ratings (0.41 and 0.72) and extremely high perspicuity values (1.72 and 1.16).  Additionally, users judged it to be quite predictable (0.61), indicating a solid basis for usability.  With visual improvements and engagement features, these problems can be resolved over time, even when the attractiveness and stimulation scores are on the lower end of the spectrum.
UEEQ | No | because the design needs about 1-2 iterations to fix engagement and attractiveness issues before release
UEEQ | No | looking at  our score l would not release the interface design
UEQ | Yes | that's what users need
UEEQ | No | The interface design has significant issues with user experience, including being perceived as unappealing and pressuring.
RAW | Yes | Good!
RAW | No | I'd add a logo or something imagery to help pull the user in
RAW | No | The notification is better to be placed in the top notification bar.
RAW | No | "I don't like the ""don't miss it"" line"
RAW | Yes | Attracting
RAW | No | I think the notification is nice but could involve more information about where it came from and who wrote it quickly by using pictures of the social media logo and the persons profile picture too.  I do like the buzz words of don't miss it .
RAW | Yes | " Having business, marketing and leadership approvals already attained and a development process already in progress the design release is the most strategic decision. It helps the company to overcome its pressing need to increase the number of users and continue the momentum of the financing in a competitive environment. Refinements can be resolved while the system is in the process of launching, but waiting to go out of business and putting assets at risk will not help."
RAW | Yes | This interface design is suitable for release because it is clear, legible, and uses a minimalist aesthetic that efficiently presents information. Familiar elements, a clear information hierarchy, subtle visual cues, and actionable notifications make it user-friendly and consistent with standard mobile UI practices.
RAW | Yes | Given the full alignment from business, marketing, and strategic leadership as well as the fact that development has already begun releasing Interface 15 supports both our immediate user engagement goals and long-term product growth. In a fast-moving, competitive market with limited runway, delaying or second-guessing approved and integrated designs could cost us momentum and investor confidence. Unless major usability concerns emerge during final testing, this design is ready for rollout.
RAW | Yes | it's not ideal, but it does have a clear call to action / is likely to have an okay CTR. the language could be more effective, but if all other parties approved it, I wouldn't stand in the way of its release
RAW | Yes | The design encourages user engagement with stories, aligns with business/marketing goals, and supports retention in a competitive market.
RAW | Yes | I think it should be released for now and tweaked later. It does the intended job of notifying the user.
RAW | Yes | Interface 15 has been approved by all key teams and is already being built by developers, so it fits our goals and is in progress. It might not be perfect, but it’s good enough to release now, and any issues can be fixed later
RAW | No | This is just a notification bubble/pop up
RAW | Yes | The time display is prominent and the notification is well-positioned. The background is attractive and the message well spaced.
RAW | Yes | it has alot of creativity, it is pleasing on the eye and has enough clarity
RAW | No | " the visual style of the gradient is clean and modern but the notification card doesn’t feel distinct enough against the background.... The text hierarchy is weak and it doesn’t actually guide the user’s attention. Also, the username and message blend in and don’t immediately stand out as the actionable part. For a lock screen notification, clarity and scannability is critical because users usually will just glance quickly... and this design would actually slow them down... It needs stronger contrast, better weight on the sender/message, and generally just more intuitive use of spacing before it’s ready."
RAW | Yes | "This design is a simple, low-risk notification for a social media story update. It provides clear, timely information (""anna__miroslawa added to their story"") with a gentle nudge (""Don’t miss it!"") that encourages engagement without being overly intrusive. The format is standard for social platforms and aligns with user expectations. Given the business approvals and the need to drive engagement (especially for features like stories, which are often high-value for retention), this design is effective and unlikely to cause negative user sentiment. It balances functionality with user control, as users can typically dismiss or ignore such notifications."
RAW | Yes | It shows that someone they know has posted to their story, meaning they are more likely to click on the notification and access the app more.
RAW | Yes | social media content
RAW | Yes | I will release it but i will improve on the colouring intergrations as one colour can be boring and therefore need to improve. Also i would need to include a hover ieffect in the notification so that i can make the usability more appealing and have more content embeded in the notification. I would also add some buttons so that I can improve the general otlook.
RAW | Yes | A smart way of not missing out on anything even on a busy day ,you will be able to be reminded of the page.
RAW | Yes | This lock screen notification is timely, emotionally resonant, and tactfully worded—“Don’t miss it!” evokes urgency without pressure.
RAW | Yes | Functional and clear.
UEEQ | No | It's annoying to the user and adds to user fatigue.
RAW | No | It could be anything
UEEQ | No | Despite good clarity and organization scores, the design is flagged as pressuring, with negative results in attractiveness and stimulation. The overall UX impact is weak, so it should not be released.
UEEQ | No | am unsure
UEEQ | No | I would not release this interface because, despite business approval, the data shows it is confusing, manipulative, and harmful to user trust—values I stand for as a data scientist, mother, and conservative who believes in honesty and personal responsibility.
UEEQ | Yes | It's user friendly, appealing, the colors are exciting .
UEEQ | No | The interface design has some issues with user experience including being perceived aspressuringand deceptive
UEEQ | No | Although clarity and efficiency scored well, the negative ratings on coercion (-1.02, pressuring) and low stimulation/attractiveness undermine user trust and enjoyment, making the risks greater than the benefits for release.

UEQ | Yes | the interface looks modern and clean
UEEQ | No | Based on UX we see a strong tendency to describing this interface as annoying, invasive and pressuring the user, restrictive as well since it doesn't let the user which pictures to grant access to and which ones no.
UEQ | Yes | The ux design is good
UEQ | No | All metrics have negative scores, indicating significant usability issues and user dissatisfaction. The composite score (-0.85) is strongly negative, suggesting that the interface's overall user experience is poor. So, I wouldn't release the interface design.

UEQ | Yes | Easy to understand
UEEQ | No | "The user testing data shows strongly negative scores across almost all UX metrics, with the composite UX quality at -0.85 and the overall mean at -0.9. Participants rated it as inefficient, unclear, unsupportive, and even unfriendly, with particularly poor attractiveness (-1.69, -1.44) and dependability (-0.95, -1.23) scores. "
UEEQ | Yes | Based on the score it seems users enjoy the interface and find it easy to use although the interface looks a bit complex to me
UEEQ | Yes | It gives you the option to limit your image selection, but for most users this can be very annoying
UEQ | No | The business side might be happy, but the UX evaluation data show significant usability problems with a composite score of -0.85 and abysmally low ratings in friendliness, clarity, enjoyment, and predictability. So releasing it now risks frustrating users and damaging trust
UEQ | No | Has lower scores

UEQ | No | "It has poor quality which poses a huge risk and means that user experience, satisfaction and ability to navigate and use it will be negatively affected.  "

UEEQ | No | It has no positive score
UEQ | No | "Just say something like: ""in order to save photos, give the app permission"", not ""yelling"" with the exclamation point"
UEEQ | No | Many indicators are very negative, I think also that it is too traditional, classic
UEEQ | No | It's definitely annoying to see all these pictures duplicated.
UEEQ | No | I chose not to release Interface 6 because the UX evaluation reveals serious usability and ethical concerns
UEQ | Yes | I would release this design as some functions just need designs like this in order to be able to allow the user to select what they need/want to select. I just don't see many other options for how to design this sort of UI differently.
UEEQ | No | "It has lack of trust and can harm users .  "
UEEQ | Yes | Interface would be ideal for first time users but if it's going to keep appearing over time it would become annoying
UEEQ | Yes | I would say the interface is clear and it's quite useful however sometimes it can become overwhelming with the information that is displayed especially for someone who just wants to quickly do something and exit
UEEQ | Yes | The visual appeal is very vibrant and fit.
UEQ | No | This interface's serious usability (-0.90 clarity, -1.23 support) and user appeal (-1.69 pleasure) flaws will irritate and turn off users, endangering the viability of our firm.

RAW | Yes | Easy to use, concise information, clear notification box.
RAW | Yes | " As the business, marketing and supervisor teams are already ratified and the developers have started the integration, it is advisable to release the design so that the other departments align. The restraint at this stage may cost it resources and growth in a very competitive market. The release approval facilitates user interaction, monetization and the necessity of the company to capture future financing."
RAW | Yes | The flow is good.
RAW | Yes | its well designed
RAW | Yes | The design enhances usability and engagement, aligns with strategic goals, and has full business approval for positive growth impact.
RAW | Yes | the design would seamlessly adapt to deifferent screens and devices
RAW | Yes | "not everyone is comfortable with sharing everything on social media. "
RAW | Yes | Very intuitive UI for the average user. Great job!
RAW | Yes | NO issues
RAW | Yes | "It's a nice clean interfact, images are nice and close together and large. Search feature is easily accessable "
RAW | No | Assuming this design is only for select photos->show photo thumbnail screen->Done and fail event, then this is missing information on the user got to the final screen.  I would think the design would show all the flow for the selection screen options(no selection, 1 or more pics selected, rights issues, etc) and all output scenarios when the Done button is pressed.
RAW | No | It does not explain the reason for access to the photo.
RAW | Yes | there is alot of balance in it and the messages were well passed
RAW | No | I feel like this could be simplified into a different window
RAW | Yes | "This interface design handles photo access permissions in a clear, user-friendly way. It provides granular control (select specific photos vs. all photos) and explains why the access is needed (""to save images""), which aligns with privacy best practices and transparency. The error state (""Failed to save photo!"") is also handled gracefully by re-prompting for access without frustration. Given the business approvals and the critical need for features that enhance user engagement (like photo sharing), this design balances functionality with privacy respect. It is low-risk and likely to improve the user experience."
RAW | Yes | Quite simple to navigate and choose pictures quickly.
RAW | Yes | This interface respects platform-level privacy standards by offering granular photo access options—“Select Photos,” “Allow All,” and “Don’t Allow”—which aligns with user expectations and regulatory norms. The messaging is consistent across both permission and error states, reinforcing clarity. However, the “Failed to save photo!” alert could be softened to reduce friction; a more empathetic tone like “Photo couldn’t be saved—please check your permissions” would maintain trust. I approve this design for release due to its functional completeness and alignment with OS-level UX conventions, but recommend a minor copy revision to improve emotional tone and reduce user frustration.
RAW | Yes | Clear and legible
UEEQ | No | It's necessary for the user to know the reason behind the photo error.
RAW | No | selecting and authorization is not fitting on the same box
RAW | Yes | This is a simple user interface to use

RAW | Yes | This design is clear and easy to use. It gives people simple choices about their photos and follows what users already know on iPhones. It builds trust and makes the app easier to use.
UEEQ | Yes | best
RAW | Yes | I think this design is engaging.
UEEQ | No | STILL LACK TO BE EVALUATE
UEEQ | No | I would not release this interface because the coercion score of -1.59 and deception score of -1.53 indicate it manipulates users through pressure and misleading feedback, violating ethical design standards.
UEEQ | No | "The interface has significant issues with with user experience "
RAW | Yes | It's got accurate information and more details in it and that makes it easier for me to see that it's will be punished in time
UEQ | No | I would not release this design because the user evaluations show consistently negative feedback. Users found the interface confusing, unfriendly, and frustrating to navigate, with low scores in clarity, predictability, and overall enjoyment. Releasing it in this state could hurt user engagement and retention, so it’s better to revise the design before launch.
UEEQ | No | The interface produced highly negative scores across clarity, dependability, and attractiveness, with strong user frustration (annoying -1.69, coercion -1.59, deception -1.53) and an overall UX KPI of -0.85, making release unsuitable

While attractiveness and stimulation are slightly negative, they don’t outweigh the overall positive composite score of 0.33. Given prior approvals and acceptable UX quality, I support its release.
UEEQ | No | "is not attractive and the ux is very risky "
UEQ | No | it lacks information
UEEQ | No | "Because it is not deceptive "
UEEQ | Yes | I would release this interface design because it's simple and effective.
UEEQ | No | Despite decent clarity and efficiency scores, the interface suffers from poor attractiveness, stimulation and trust metrics, which could harm user engagment and retention.
UEQ | No | The interface is not consistent
UEQ | No | Negative scores across various UX metrics
UEQ | Yes | More good results to expect
UEEQ | Yes | I will realising it for the best coments
UEQ | No | "it have lot of mistakes and not attractive "
UEEQ | No | it is under pressure and will crash leaving customers or current users in the dark or ruining their plans
UEQ | Yes | the interface is easy to use, efficient and predictable
UEEQ | Yes | The UX design is solid
UEQ | Yes | the assessment score is good
UEQ | No | There are way too many negative scores which means the interface is not good
UEQ | Yes | It is clear and easy to use
UEQ | Yes | The interface has mixed scores, with some positive scores for Efficiency. The composite score (0.1) is neutral, suggesting that the interface's overall user experience is neither strongly positive nor strongly negative.
UEEQ | No | It shows inconsistent engagement and therefore unreliable
UEQ | No | "I am not too confident about this interface, the scores are not that good, I don't think it is that efficient "
UEEQ | Yes | will release it is easy to use
UEQ | No | "No not in its current state because the streak display functions but it's also plain,if there vould be engaging animations they could increase motivation. "
UEQ | Yes | "The interface scored positively  and that indicates that the users found the interface  to be easy to use, efficient  and predictable.  Even though there's some negativity,  there's still room for improvement "
UEEQ | No | While the design scores positively in core usability—efficiency (0.34), clarity (0.61), and ease of use (1.06)—there are significant negatives in areas that affect long-term user retention and trust. Notably, the coercion score is extremely poor (-1.83), suggesting users feel pressured, which can quickly erode goodwill and cause churn. Attractiveness (-0.73, -0.87) and stimulation (-0.23, -0.63) are also negative, indicating the interface risks being perceived as unappealing and unengaging.
UEEQ | Yes | I am happy with the interfaces and the score given by users, it gives me confidence that the right decision was made
UEEQ | Yes | Beautiful design
UEEQ | No | The pressuring lable shows that users feel that they are not in control and they feel manipulated
UEEQ | Yes | Motivates you to make further progress
UEQ | Yes | simple and clear instructions and steps to follow
UEEQ | No | The wording of the text sounds as if the user is being pressured to interact or use the interface daily.
UEQ | No | again, its in the copy, 'but be careful' you should reinforce the interaction no warm against it. It could be keep your streak up, or don't let your streak reset keep chatting with steve etc
UEQ | No | "Will give no approval "
UEQ | No | It has a negative rating in terms of quality. It is not user friendly hence it could negatively affect user engagement by making it hard for them to navigate and complete their requests.
UEEQ | No | The decision to not release the interface design is based on the absence of detailed evaluation data and business approval information.
UEQ | Yes | "It is very Accurate "
UEQ | Yes | Looks okay to me
UEQ | No | "is appealing, lacks modern design elements "
UEQ | Yes | I say yes because I would release it for business to grow
UEQ | Yes | Positive UX score
UEEQ | No | again like most the user data shows this design is extremely awful -183 unfriendly -0.87 and uninteresting -0.63 these are bad failures for a social media startup that needs to build trust and engagement
UEEQ | No | The user experience seems to not be meeting high enough standards for a release, it should be tweaked beforehand until it reaches an higher standard.
UEQ | Yes | "There are still improvements that need to be done but it can be released since it does not pose any harm or danger "
UEQ | No | "The design have many risks that needs to be fixed "
UEQ | No | still seems too much obstructive: say what you can do, not what you cannot
UEEQ | No | This design is not very visually appealing.
UEEQ | No | I chose not to release Interface 7 because the streak feature introduces a coercive dynamic that risks alienating users
UEQ | Yes | I would be likely to release this design as it isn't to dissimilar to other UI's used by social media etc. apps already. It is simple but visually appealing with the layout and graphics used.
UEEQ | No | The users don't seem to react positively with the functionality and overall ability to satisfy the user of the system. They also deemed the design untrustworthy by negative point on coercion, disguise, and deception.
UEEQ | Yes | "There are some positive aspects but more work needs to be done to earn trust from users "
UEQ | Yes | The interface has both weak points and strong points and i would release it but i will also try to fix all the weaknesses as soon as possible
UEQ | No | Its low stimulation -0.23/-0.63 and attractiveness -0.73/-0.87 ratings suggest that consumers would find it uninteresting and unengaging, which is a serious shortcoming for a social media site.  Concerns around customer displeasure are also raised by the reliability support score of -0.55.  The dangers to user retention exceed the advantages, particularly for a business that requires strong engagement, even though the total score (0.1) is somewhat favourable.  Before launching, I would advise iterating on the interface and visual appeal.
UEEQ | No | i would not release the design because the combination of poor attractiveness, ethical concerns and low engagement outweighs the positives
UEEQ | Yes | to gain profit
UEQ | Yes | It is because every goal is meet
UEEQ | Yes | I made my decision based on careful consideration of the available options and weighing the pros and cons of each choice. After evaluating the information, I chose the option that best aligned with my goals and priorities.
RAW | Yes | Fun - right?!
RAW | Yes | Given that the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor have all approved the design, and the development team has already started integrating it, withholding my final approval would be a significant professional and business risk. The company is in a competitive market with limited runway, and this design is considered pivotal for success. My role at this stage is to provide a final sign-off, and all prior evaluations have already confirmed the design's alignment with business goals.
RAW | Yes | All seem well wih the design.
RAW | No | it is not so eye catching and may not impress the users
RAW | Yes | Gamification is important to some users
RAW | Yes | Great
RAW | Yes | " The design has already been approved by all key stakeholders such as the business, marketing and the supervisors and developers are busy in integrating it which is a pointer of organization-wide alignment. As the interface will foster user interaction and financial gains, the launch thereof will contribute towards the development of the startup within a competitive environment. By postponing release, the momentum might be put at risk hence proceeding is the optimal decision."
RAW | Yes | With strong endorsements from business, marketing, and strategic leadership, and the development team already progressing with integration, releasing Interface 7 aligns perfectly with our need to stay competitive and keep users engaged. The evaluation data indicates positive user experience and potential revenue impact, making this a timely and strategic move. Unless unexpected usability issues arise, proceeding with the release supports our growth and funding goals.
RAW | No | this has an obvious & glaring spelling error which could be quickly rectified. I'd be extremely surprised that this were approved by all other parties named, but that absolutely would need to be fixed. there are other elements that could be optimized, but they're less crucial
RAW | Yes | Due to its positive content
RAW | No | it needs correction
RAW | Yes | The design improves user interaction and engagement potential, with strong business approval, though real-world testing will ensure smooth adoption.
RAW | Yes | the design is visually appealing
RAW | Yes | "it has clear communication and easy to understand "
RAW | Yes | The interface looks excellent and is very user-friendly.
RAW | No | Needs cleaning up. Looks a bit rough and lacks quality. Could use polishing as well as the design is a bit boring
RAW | Yes | Even with internal approvals, a poor user experience can damage trust and stall growth.
RAW | No | even though the flame and the streak tracker look good, the way it’s written feels off. It comes across more like a warning than encouragement, and that kind of tone can make people feel pressured instead of motivated... The design should celebrate the streak and make the user feel proud of keeping it going, not stressed that they’re about to lose it. If the copy was shifted to highlight the achievement and frame tomorrow as another chance to build on it, then it would feel more positive and worth releasing.
RAW | No | "I think it's a little bit too pushy, maybe I would change it to ""lets keep the streak up!"" "
RAW | No | "I would not release this ""streak"" feature design. While it may drive short-term engagement by leveraging gamification and fear of loss (your streak will reset), it promotes unhealthy usage patterns and can create social pressure or anxiety for users"
RAW | Yes | This design has a user centred design which enhances the users experience on snapchat and ensures the user continues to use the app.
RAW | Yes | This is great in terms of design, certain pages should contain less information and should encourage pinpointed entries to make the page less boring.
UEEQ | Yes | Streaks maintain user engagement.
RAW | Yes | love it
RAW | Yes | appears acceptable
UEEQ | Yes | i like it
UEEQ | No | I would not release this interface because the coercion score of -1.83 indicates it is highly pressuring and manipulative, exploiting user behavior through fear of loss.
UEEQ | Yes | The design is simple and easy to understand
UEQ | No | The interface received low ratings from users for friendliness and emotional engagement so I did not approve it. Although the clarity is acceptable  the overall UX score of 0.1 indicates low satisfaction  Users may become frustrated and lose faith in the platform if it is release.
RAW | No | Definitely would not release the design prioritizes coercive engagement over positive user well-being and lacks professional polish, making it unsuitable for release.
UEQ | Yes | I would release this design because it is easy to use, fairly organized, and reasonably predictable, with mostly positive user feedback.
UEEQ | No | Although overall UX quality is slightly positive (0.10), the strong negative score on coercion (-1.83, pressuring) and poor attractiveness ratings indicate the design risks alienating users by making them feel manipulated, undermining trust and long-term engagement.

PATTERN 8 (94 explanations)
------------------------------
UEQ | Yes | users find the design clear and easy to understand
UEQ | No | "Will need to put in the disadvantages and advantages first and making sure is there room for improvement "
UEEQ | Yes | These are great numbers and they provide  positive feedback
UEQ | Yes | "I love the quality of the design "
UEQ | No | "Account can be deleted permanently "
UEQ | Yes | There is potential of boosting
UEQ | Yes | looks ready
UEEQ | No | would prefer simpler message
UEQ | Yes | its safe
UEQ | Yes | I would release this interface design because the overall UX quality score (0.18) is positive, meaning the experience is generally acceptable to users.
UEEQ | No | "it is inefficient and confusing to use "
UEQ | Yes | good
UEQ | Yes | It has all the necessary information
UEQ | No | My account has been deactivated
UEEQ | No | "I would launch because it is not deceptive "
UEEQ | No | I would not release this design because it's boring and difficult to read.
UEEQ | Yes | This interface performs reasonably well on efficiency, clarity, and dependability, with a slightly positive overall UX score. While attractiveness and deception scores are low these issues can be refined post launch.
UEQ | Yes | The visual design of the interface is clear
UEQ | No | The overall UX Quality of 0.18 indicates that there are issues that still need to be addressed to improve user experience
UEEQ | No | "The improvement.is in need in that design  to bring best "
UEQ | Yes | it have lot of attraction
UEEQ | Yes | The UX explain the text well
UEQ | Yes | It's not that bad
UEQ | Yes | This interface design is predictable, easy and clear
UEEQ | Yes | "The score is looking good "
UEEQ | No | "It shows some ineffecient "
UEQ | Yes | This interface is easy to understand and is more efficient.
UEEQ | No | The UI is just plain.
UEQ | Yes | "The UX provides valuable insight into strength and weaknesses of the interface design. "
UEQ | No | The risk is a bit too much, I would be losing a lot.
UEQ | Yes | "The interface score some  positive score and that indicates the is a room from improvement. "
UEEQ | Yes | it seems to have moderate UX performance
UEEQ | Yes | The interface shows solid strengths in core usability—efficiency (0.43, 0.40), clarity (0.53), and predictability (0.70)—meaning users should be able to navigate it with minimal confusion. While emotional appeal scores like attractiveness (-0.44, -0.47) and stimulation (-0.15, 0.03) are slightly negative, they are mild and unlikely to cause major adoption issues in the short term. Trust-related scores (deception -0.76) are somewhat concerning, but not critically low, and can be addressed in follow-up iterations. Given the positive composite UX score (0.18), strong business backing, and the market need for quick deployment, the design is suitable for release, with plans to enhance friendliness and excitement later.
UEEQ | No | I am torn between deciding whether I would release this design or not even though there is no major issues with the interfaces design
UEEQ | No | It needs improvement  l will redesign
UEEQ | No | The deceptive lable means users feel cheated, manipulated or misled
UEQ | Yes | "It will help the user know the duration given before the action will be completed "
UEEQ | No | The wording in the message is not very clear and it can be confusing.
UEQ | No | "It will have to go through a copywriter before I can approve it. A wall of text is never a good thing given that there is no option for a resolution. You are effectively telling the user this is happening regardless which is a poor experience and no metrics can give any more insight than that. "
UEQ | Yes | "Implement each "
UEEQ | No | My account will be deactivated
UEQ | Yes | "It is more friendly "
UEQ | Yes | Seems okay to me
UEQ | Yes | mostly ok, but needs some more clarification of using the phrase during activation
UEEQ | Yes | The text is structure well as a warning, there's not much design to it other than the font used but for what it is, it works well.
UEQ | Yes | "Because I foresee great potential and outcomes "
UEQ | Yes | The risks that are present are tolerable so I would release it
UEEQ | No | there are a few points that could be increased too
UEEQ | Yes | There's just no easier and friendlier way to explain terms of an action. Maybe a nice neutral color box might make a difference.
UEEQ | Yes | "The design needs more work "
UEEQ | No | "Because it was too blunt and no attractiveness "
UEQ | Yes | "While there is still room for improvement i would release this model and ensure to fix all the weaknesses "
UEEQ | Yes | so that i won't be deactiviated
UEQ | Yes | the goal is meet
UEEQ | No | I chose to not release the interface design because despite the neutral release tendency score , I believe the design requires further refinement to meet the desired standards. The evaluation data and business approval may have highlighted some concerns that need to be addressed before releasing the design. I would like to revisit the design and make sure it meets the required criteria  and user expectations.
RAW | Yes | Good stuff
RAW | Yes | Given that the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor have all approved the design, and the development team has already begun integration, withholding my final approval would be a significant professional and business risk. The company is in a competitive market with limited runway, and this design is considered pivotal for success. My role at this stage is to provide a final sign-off, and all prior evaluations have already confirmed the design's alignment with business goals. Refusing approval at this late stage would halt progress, waste resources, and undermine the entire team's work, which is not a responsible action for a UX Design Lead in this context.
RAW | Yes | it seems simple enough
RAW | Yes | The copy is clear.
RAW | Yes | Amazing
RAW | Yes | "I like that it is easy to read, in black and white.  Good choice on the type and size of the font.  It makes it's point. "
RAW | Yes | " The interface can be released because business, marketing and leadership have already approved, and developers have started the integration which does not mean any extra delays and wastage of resources. The layout is in accordance with growth priorities, and it provides a high possibility to attract and keep the users in the competitive market. The monitoring of risks can be done after the launch, however, refusing approval at this point would harm the momentum and chances of financing."
RAW | No | The current design, while clear about the deactivation and deletion timeline, lacks crucial elements for a user-friendly and safe experience, which is paramount in interface design.
RAW | Yes | Given the unanimous approval from the business team, marketing, and my supervisor, along with strong evaluation data supporting user engagement and revenue potential, releasing Interface 8 is a strategic step forward. The design is aligned with our competitive needs and has already begun development integration, so moving ahead now helps maintain momentum. I trust the interface meets usability and accessibility standards, making it suitable for launch.
RAW | No | there are obvious grammatical errors that come off as very unprofessional. such messaging should always be in correct English (assuming an English UI), and fixing this would not be time-consuming
RAW | Yes | "I would release this but correct the grammatical error, ""...your account won't be visible to public"" to ""...your account won't be visible to the public""."
RAW | Yes | the design uses simple language that is easy to understand
RAW | No | It is very bare bones and simplistic. Improvements could be made.
RAW | Yes | "The design in this case does not matter. As long as the CTA works, it is fine. "
RAW | Yes | With business, marketing, and supervisor approval, and assuming the interface passes accessibility standards, releasing it would support company goals
RAW | No | Need a link with further explanations/legalize docs to the user and contact phone numbers.  We need to cover ourselves from any litigation or misunderstandings.
RAW | No | The context is not clear and the tone applied sounds rather casual to talk about account deletion.
RAW | No | it is too basic, it could improve for better
RAW | No | "the message is clear but the tone and structure are heavy and not very user friendly... especially since deactivation and permanent deletion are sensitive actions.. i would make the interface eel more empathetic.Also there’s no hierarchy highlighting the 30 day recovery period as the main reassurance. It would work better if the design emphasised that users have time to change their mind with a softer tone and possibly a link to support resources. The layout could also break up the information into digestible parts instead of one block of text. "
RAW | Yes | It is detailed and explains the exact process for the user so they know they have time to rejoin.
RAW | Yes | growth business team and marketing development
RAW | No | Hit the message with while espressing words of affirmation while rendering a sorrowful tone. Why? Because people need to see seriousness with the platform guidelines, add buttons to also convey the message and express feelings.
RAW | Yes | I approve this interface for release, but with the clear intention that it undergo a UI upgrade. The current text is plainly typed and lacks visual hierarchy or emotional resonance. Given the sensitivity of account deactivation and deletion, the interface should be designed with more care, using layout, typography, and tone to guide users through the process with clarity and empathy.
RAW | Yes | Legible and gets the point across.
RAW | No | it's too random
RAW | Yes | it is clear statement but poor design
RAW | Yes | It's not the most appealing design but does the job
UEEQ | No | While efficiency and clarity scores are mildly positive, the design is rated as deceptive and carries negative impressions in attractiveness and coercion. This creates trust issues, making it unfit for release.
RAW | Yes | There are no identified usability or technical issues
RAW | Yes | The design is clear and respectful. It explains the 30-day deactivation and permanent delete in simple words. It gives users control and avoids negative language, which makes the app feel safe and professional.
UEEQ | Yes | it looks more marketable and artistic
RAW | Yes | It is an acceptable design
UEEQ | Yes | HAVE GOOD QAULITY
UEEQ | No | I would not release this interface because it is highly deceptive (-0.76) and lacks clear user control. The message states that the account will be deleted permanently after 30 days, but there is no option to confirm, cancel, or reverse the action. This creates a high risk of accidental permanent deletion, especially for users who may not fully understand the consequence.
UEEQ | No | I would not release this interface as it is difficult to use and unclear
UEQ | Yes | The interface received high marks for predictability and clarity so I gave it my blessing  Supportiveness and emotional involvement were lower but they were not major obstacles  With only slight tone adjustments it is safe to release because the overall UX risk is minimal.
RAW | No | "Because shows some negative impact about my account so this can't be something to release it people will think bad about my decision "
UEQ | No | "The UX design shows a lot of negative scores in key areas, like attractiveness and stimulation. Which suggests that it isn't optimal for release. "
UEQ | Yes | I decided to release this design because the user evaluation data shows that it is easy to use, organized, and mostly reliable, with positive scores in efficiency, perspicuity, and dependability. Although stimulation and attractiveness received slightly negative scores, these are minor issues that do not significantly impact overall usability. Since the design also has business, marketing, and supervisor approval, it is ready for release, with the option to make small improvements later.

PATTERN 9 (86 explanations)
------------------------------
UEQ | No | the design is not well recevied by users and is overall unpleasant to interact with
UEQ | No | "People doesn’t need it during this season "
UEQ | Yes | "Its giving high hopes that it will boost up "
UEQ | No | very low score
UEEQ | Yes | looks good enough , no other improvements imo
UEQ | Yes | because it safe to do so
UEEQ | Yes | "Dependable and Exciting "
UEQ | Yes | good
UEQ | No | it is not eye catching
UEQ | No | It's AI
UEEQ | No | I would not release this design because it applies a lot of pressure to the user.
UEEQ | No | We wouldn't approve this design because it was found to be intrusive, coercive and obstructive to their experience. The notification prompt negatively impacts trust, enjoyment, and overall usability as reflected in the poor UX evaluation scores.
UEQ | No | Negative scores across metrics.
UEQ | Yes | "High potential "
UEEQ | No | red line margine, we gotta improve somethings about the app to reach the green margine
UEQ | No | the interface is not secure, dependable or attractive to customers
UEEQ | No | The UX design is block by a pop up
UEQ | No | "High risk "
UEQ | Yes | The design is attractive and luring.
UEQ | No | Most metrics have negative scores, indicating significant usability issues and user dissatisfaction. The composite score (-0.94) is strongly negative, suggesting that the interface's overall user experience is poor.
UEEQ | Yes | "Has many preferences yet it gives pressure "
UEEQ | No | From the statistics it seems users find it inefficient and this may increase frustrations.
UEQ | No | I am not too confident about this interface, it is not efficient enough. The scores aren't that good too
UEEQ | No | "will not release reason being it will disturbing and annoying to the user "
UEQ | No | Because of the poor UX evaluation results
UEQ | Yes | Yes I would. It's familiar to the user and very easy.
UEQ | No | It seems to have a lot of negative scores
UEQ | No | "It has so many  strongly negatively in several categories and this suggests that the users found  the interface to be highly inefficient  and obstructive "
UEEQ | No | This interface has severe negative ratings across key UX areas. Efficiency (-0.71, -0.71) and clarity (-0.23) are weak, while supportiveness is extremely low (-2.08), indicating a frustrating and obstructive experience. Engagement metrics are highly negative, with stimulation (-1.26, -1.79) and attractiveness (-1.97, -1.73) suggesting users find it both unappealing and uninteresting.
UEEQ | Yes | "It's q beautiful design "
UEEQ | No | This label in deep red shows that users are feeling emotionally distressed and they feel manipulated
UEQ | Yes | "The system appears functional and understandable "
UEQ | Yes | "It is a better way to know who and who engage in your social account "
UEQ | No | metrics easy descison here, its obstructive
UEQ | Yes | As we all ingage new ideas will come
UEQ | No | "It has many flaws and issues which will negatively affect quality, usability and user experience  "
UEEQ | Yes | The design is released based on positive business approval And evaluation data, with the understanding that further refinement is possible through feedback
UEEQ | Yes | It's presuringm
UEQ | No | "It is not effective  and appealing "
UEQ | No | I would recommend a re-review to ensure the UX evaluations were accurate, since the design looks okay, regardless.
UEQ | No | the pop up for enabling notification access needs rework, plus button too big, the logo is taking up too much space
UEEQ | No | the data is again just awful the design is rated as extremely pressuring -226 and unfriendly -173 it is also very obstructive -208 and annoying -197 this design is like a dark pattern that would drive users away and ruin the company
UEEQ | No | The user should be prompted with the least amount of things as possible, nobody wants their search or scrolling to be interrupted by a pop up, it's very intrusive this way. The user reviews also seem to reflect a dislike.
UEEQ | No | Very less positive matrics
UEQ | Yes | AI looks wrong, it is a bit obstructive, but I would let it pass
UEEQ | No | "I chose not to release Interface 9 because the user experience data reveals serious concerns that conflict with our design principles and long-term engagement goals. "
UEQ | No | I would not choose to release this design as it is intrusive and invades the users screen. This sort of message/notification would be much better suited to a discrete tab that shows at the top of the screen, much the same way text messages do on most mobile phones these days.
UEEQ | Yes | THe idea is sound, but it limits the user's freedom of choice by giving them options to handle or customize their notifications.
UEEQ | Yes | I think it is a good feature to have for an interface it makes things much easier to get a notification on your screen and you can decide from there and there if you want to open it or you can just choose not to open it at that current moment so I think the interface is a good idea and based on people's Score they would enjoy using this interface
UEEQ | Yes | The user friendly and the clear color graphics.
UEQ | No | The interface scores catastrophically low in engagement (-1.79 stimulation) and usability (-2.08 dependability support), making it actively hostile to users despite business approvals. Confidence 7/7 and hese scores predict user abandonment, which no startup can afford.
UEEQ | Yes | depending on the score
UEQ | No | goal not meet
RAW | Yes | "Simple notification, easy enough "
RAW | Yes | Given that the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor have all approved the design, and the development team has already started integrating it, withholding my final approval would be a significant professional and business risk. The company is in a competitive market with limited runway, and this design is considered pivotal for success. My role at this stage is to provide a final sign-off, and all prior evaluations have already confirmed the design's alignment with business goals. Refusing approval at this late stage would halt progress, waste resources, and undermine the entire team's work, which is not a responsible action for a UX Design Lead in this context.
RAW | Yes | i like the interface
RAW | No | "The copy should be re-written to something like ""You can turn notifications on"" - not pleading with the user"
RAW | Yes | "Interesting "
RAW | No | "The notification prompt should not be released as-is because it lacks clear visual hierarchy, uses an ambiguous ""OK"" button, and interrupts the user’s experience without offering nuanced control. Improvements are needed in button clarity, prominence of the primary action, timing, and options to ensure better usability and reduce user frustration."
RAW | Yes | approved
RAW | No | that will be alot of notification
RAW | Yes | Prompting notifications boosts engagement and retention. Clear design with choice reduces frustration, but timing and frequency must avoid annoyance.
RAW | Yes | the design is optimized for mobile devices
RAW | Yes | With all key stakeholders aligned, integration already in progress, and no UX blockers identified.
RAW | Yes | If the design is only for the pop, I guess that's fine and I would sign off.
RAW | No | It blocks the content that the user is currently viewing.
RAW | Yes | i really like its consistency, it uses a unified style in font and colour
RAW | No | The pop-up takes over the whole feed in the middle of scrolling, which breaks the flow and makes it look pushy. The copy isn’t the worst, but paired with the design it comes across like the app is begging for permission instead of making it feel useful. There’s no clear hierarchy so both buttons look the same, the modal just floats in the middle with no context, and it covers the content people actually came here to see. A better design would introduce notifications in a less intrusive way, maybe as a banner or a card integrated into the feed, so it feels part of the experience instead of interrupting it.
RAW | No | It's instrusive by nature, but the text could be shortened/changed to be improved.
RAW | No | "While the notification prompt is visually clean and offers a clear choice (""Not now"" or ""OK""), its placement is disruptive—it appears mid-feed, interrupting the user's content consumption. This can create friction and feel intrusive, especially if the user is engaged with posts. Additionally, the prompt lacks context about why notifications are beneficial beyond basic engagement (e.g., ""stay connected"" or ""never miss updates from friends""). Given the competitive market and the need to prioritize seamless user experience, I would reject this design and advocate for a less intrusive approach—such as a subtle banner, a dedicated settings prompt, or a delayed request after positive user interactions (e.g., after a like or follow). This respects user autonomy and reduces potential annoyance."
RAW | Yes | It enhances the users experience and allows the user to click on the app more often.
RAW | Yes | currently approved interface
RAW | Yes | I would release this as a beta phase, keeping in mind that the design is not that perfect. Firstly the corners of the post are a bit sharp and it would look more professional if the posts has rounded corners. Secondly, I would also intergrate AI in this posts to make the user understand what this post about. Enable and adjust the like and comment buttons to be somewhere easily accessible so that we can improve user experience.
RAW | Yes | This interface integrates the notification prompt in a timely and visually unobtrusive way, surfacing it during active engagement without hijacking the user’s flow.
RAW | Yes | It's simple and effective
RAW | Yes | good design clear statement
RAW | Yes | This is informative and useful
UEEQ | No | Strongly negative scores in coercion, dependability, attractiveness, and deception show that users feel pressured and manipulated. Overall UX quality is negative, making this design unsuitable.
RAW | Yes | "The design poses no threat "
UEEQ | No | IT LACK INFORMATOIN
UEEQ | No | I would not release this interface because the coercion score of -2.26 indicates it is highly pressuring and manipulative, violating user autonomy and ethical design principles.
UEEQ | No | "The notification is obtrusive and should be part of a different workflow, maybe early in the signup process. "
UEQ | No | Because of the interface  low ratings for excitement  and support I did not approve it Users said it was uninteresting  and hostile so it should not be released without a significant makeover.
RAW | Yes | I will because its more appealing and showing more accurate information and attractive to people fall for it
UEQ | No | I would not release this design because it is confusing, obstructive, and unfriendly, and overall feedback is very negative.
UEEQ | No | The design was rated highly pressuring (-2.26) and strongly negative across stimulation and attractiveness metrics, with an overall UX KPI of -0.94, making it manipulative and harmful to user trust despite business approval.

PATTERN 10 (88 explanations)
------------------------------
UEQ | No | "A lot of unfinished profile information "
UEEQ | No | This evaluation shows bad numbers and this cant be released even for research purposes
UEQ | Yes | "Setting up the interface to be noticed "
UEQ | Yes | Its giving little hopes of it rising up
UEQ | No | low score
UEEQ | No | ui too simple and same color
UEQ | No | its not safe
UEQ | No | I would not release this interface because the overall UX quality score (-0.57) is negative, indicating that user testing revealed more issues than positives. Key usability concerns include poor organization (Cluttered vs. Organized at -1.20) and lack of clarity (Confusing vs. Clear at -1.12), which suggest users may struggle to navigate or understand the interface. Emotional engagement is also weak, with low friendliness (-0.88) and enjoyment (-0.57), meaning the design is unlikely to feel inviting or satisfying. These problems could reduce adoption rates, increase drop-offs, and harm retention critical risks in a competitive startup environment, so improvements should be made before release.
UEQ | No | it has many rules
UEQ | No | It's not human works
UEQ | No | The interface is not well organized
UEQ | No | Negative scores across metrics.
UEQ | No | Low potential of hopes
UEEQ | No | "This will need to be redesign before realising it "
UEEQ | No | even though there is progress in the growth however the graph is still on the negative red danger meaning releasing at this time we puting everything  at risk

UEQ | No | The UX assessment score is very low.
UEQ | No | It looks dull and boring.
UEEQ | Yes | With these details it's giving average risk
UEEQ | No | The UI is too plain it would need some adjustments.
UEQ | Yes | "The data provides clear indication of the design shortcomings "
UEQ | Yes | "Yes i would because the settings are clearly structured and each option includes an explanation and it increases userbility,it's not confusing. "
UEQ | No | "The  data suggests that the interface needs significant  improvement to meet user expectations and provide  a satisfying experience "
UEEQ | No | FRIENDLINESS AND ATTRACTIVENESS IMPROVEMENTS AND REDUCING DECEPTION AND COERCION
UEQ | Yes | "Based on the reviews "
UEEQ | No | I wouldn't release Interface 10 due to its poor user experience scores, which could lead to user frustration and low engagement. The design's issues with efficiency, perspicuity, and attractiveness outweigh its potential business benefits. Revising the design to address these issues is essential before considering release
UEEQ | No | There is too much information that's why users are feeling cluttered, this slows their completion time
UEEQ | No | The interface is difficult to read, lacks clarity and division, everything blends together
UEQ | No | Low engagement, weak visual appeal, and mixed efficiency results could affect long-term satisfaction
UEQ | Yes | It allows the people to change their social settings with ease
UEEQ | No | The interface seems cluttered and the user can loose focus when using it.
UEQ | No | "Release "
UEQ | No | "The design is flawed and has serious issues in terms of user experience which mean releasing it would negatively affect client retention and revenue generation.  "
UEEQ | Yes | Everything is good in the design
UEQ | No | Needs updating
UEEQ | No | "Overall quality is negative "
UEQ | No | "The design still needs some improvements "
UEQ | No | It needs refinement to reduce obstructions, improve clarity, and make the interface more engaging. Releasing it as is risks frustrating users, damaging credibility, and leading to low adoption.
UEQ | No | Text too small, overall confusing
UEEQ | Yes | The UX Evaluation Details are often negative. Before giving my final design approval, I'd analyze further the reasons why other teams approved this interface design
UEEQ | No | There's too much information and no enough space between the lines.
UEQ | No | I would choose not to release this design as the UI is overall just too cluttered. Separating the options into drop down menus would have been a better choice for such a UI rather than the currently displayed design.
UEEQ | No | Bad score , releasing may lead to bad users experience
UEEQ | No | I feel that the layout of the interface has too much information going on it is gluttered and it will make it hard for people to want to go through each and every option
UEEQ | No | There is a lot of information provided on the interface if perhaps certain parts can be removed redesigned I would consider using the interface
UEQ | No | "My decision not to release the interface is based on the negative feedback from the UX evaluation scores are indicating clutter, confusion and lack of enjoyment while using the interface "
UEQ | No | The gauge shows that the design sits below zero, closer to the red and orange zones, which represent poor user experience. This means users rated the interface as below average overall, finding it less clear, less enjoyable, and less usable compared to a neutral or positive design and also The overall UX quality is negative 0.57, which confirms that users had a bad experience. Since a social media product depends heavily on clarity, friendliness, and enjoyment to attract and keep users, releasing this version would be too risky and could harm adoption.
UEEQ | Yes | looking at the score l would take the decision to release this interface design
UEQ | Yes | "Very clear and explains more  details "
UEQ | No | it did not reach the goal
RAW | Yes | A bit messy but short on time!
RAW | No | The UI design is bland.
RAW | No | it page is too bulky, there is not a lot of room for the user to process
RAW | No | "While the colors are nice and everything is organized well, I do not think that its a settings page that is easy enough to navigate.  The print is small and not aesthetically pleasing.  I think making the typeface bigger and more spacing between everything on the top part will help this problem.   Also the line work for the general settings could be better.  "
RAW | Yes | " The interface is the most strategic option since the business, marketing and supervisor have already agreed on this and the developers have started doing the integration. Its approval will facilitate quicker growth, enable the company to remain competitive in a competitive market, and will be in line with the company dire need to win and retain users. Any postponement to release may result in a stalled momentum and funding opportunities will be lost."
RAW | No | No, this interface design should not be released as it has multiple usability issues, including poor information hierarchy, redundant sections, inconsistent action placement, and unclear interactive elements. The cluttered layout and repetitive explanations further reduce readability and make navigation confusing for users.
RAW | Yes | Interface 10 has received comprehensive support from all relevant departments, including marketing, business, and leadership, which suggests it's aligned with both user engagement goals and revenue projections. Given the urgency of our competitive position and limited runway, pushing forward with a fully vetted and partially integrated design minimizes disruption while maximizing potential upside. Unless any late-stage usability issues arise, I see no reason to delay release.
RAW | No | this looks like it was written in a notes app. none of the items under the first 'general' heading are clearly linking to anything, and the order doesn't match that of the items lower in the page. simply removing the toc part at the top would make it substantially better, if one wanted a quickly deployable solution
RAW | Yes | due to its quality
RAW | No | It looks cluttered. Not user friendly. Gives the user too many options. Sectioning would help.
RAW | Yes | it is clear
RAW | No | the design is too ambiguous
RAW | Yes | I feel like it is easy to edit stuff on this design, and it include most of the features that are easy to use.
RAW | Yes | No issues on this design
RAW | No | This is a scrambled mess, there's no sectional division. It needs to be cleaned up and laid out better
RAW | Yes | Given stakeholder alignment, assumed UX validation, and the current phase of integration, Interface 10 should be approved for release
RAW | No | "The layout is too cluttered.  This is not good design or flow.  This is not user friendly. "
RAW | No | There is a long list containing too many ungrouped options which have no particular prioritization.
RAW | No | It looks like a wall of text, too cluttered.
RAW | No | This does not specifically show how the app works or how the user can use it.
RAW | No | Firstly this design interface is too wordy and for a reason I would recommend taking it back to design process and redesign the page interface and add more interface so as to make it more appealing to users, furthermore the design would look more better if the CSS styling is added. The page content should remain the same as its good.
RAW | Yes | The fact that one can have power to change or edit anything it gives them sense of ownership.
RAW | No | I approve this interface for release based on its functional completeness and strategic alignment with user control and page management. However, the current design is visually dense and lacks hierarchy, which could overwhelm users and hinder discoverability. The interface would benefit from a UI upgrade, introducing progressive disclosure (e.g., collapsible sections), clearer visual grouping, and iconography to guide attention. These enhancements would make the experience more intuitive and emotionally attuned, especially for users managing complex page settings.
RAW | No | "Looks thrown on page. Needs to be more space between setting topics and they need to look clickable. Chosen setting should open in new modal with ""save/cancel"" buttons. Individual setting modal should have more space above bold text items and Edit buttons should be darker."
RAW | Yes | yes but top of page is ambigious because seem cant be changed
RAW | No | The design doesn't fit the screen properly
UEEQ | No | The design is cluttered and difficult to use, with negative scores in efficiency, clarity, and overall UX quality. It would frustrate users and lower satisfaction.
RAW | Yes | There are no identified usability or technical issues
RAW | Yes | This design is simple and organized. All settings are in one place, with clear “Edit” buttons. It is easy for users to manage their page and make changes quickly.
UEEQ | Yes | outstanding it is.
RAW | Yes | I think the design is acceptable, even though I think that the orange color in the menu should be of a darker shade.
UEEQ | No | HAVE SO MANY NEGATIVITY
UEEQ | No | "The page is cluttered. Too much white space on the right. No uniformity in the text font. Colors are not appealing. It's not a clean look. Icons are too generic. "
UEEQ | Yes | The interface is clean, easy to use and it adheres to standard UX principles
UEQ | No | Users gave the interface low marks for emotional tone and layout so I did not approve it  It appeared cluttered confused  and unpleasant, with a UX score of -0.57, which presented serious risks to trust and engagement.
UEQ | No | "The settings interface seems to be performing poorly across nearly all user experience metrics. The design appears to be complex, which users find difficult to navigate. "
UEEQ | No | The clutter score of -1.2 and overall UX KPI of -0.57 confirm a negative user experience, indicating the interface feels overly crowded and confusing, which poses a risk for adoption.

UEQ | Yes | The UX design is very good
UEQ | Yes | "The interface is user friendly and interesting "
UEQ | Yes | The interface has positive scores across most metrics, indicating that users find it efficient. The composite score (0.85) is strongly positive, suggesting that the interface's overall user experience is excellent. So, I would release the interface design.
UEEQ | Yes | Users find it effecient and easier to use
UEQ | Yes | The feedback is already positive because everyone approved, this interface is efficient and consistent enough and will accommodate users needs hence why I approve.
UEEQ | Yes | The UI has all the elements needed for a such a UI.
UEQ | Yes | The interface datadesign is considered suitable to release with the recommendation of user experience.
UEQ | Yes | I would release it because it is dependable
UEQ | Yes | "The interface strength is highly score and that means the users find it very easy  to use and efficient "
UEEQ | Yes | there are minor gaps and there's positive user sentiment and quite low on deception meaning there's great transperancy
UEQ | Yes | It's friendly
UEEQ | Yes | This interface performs very well in the core usability metrics: high efficiency (0.97, 0.75), strong clarity and ease of use (1.66, 0.59), and supportive interaction (1.07). Emotional engagement scores are also positive overall, with friendliness (0.80) and enjoyability (0.34) being above average. The trust metrics are reassuring, with no major red flags for deception (0.07) and a strong transparency score (1.11).
UEEQ | Yes | I would release Interface 11 because its UX evaluation scores indicate a strong user experience. The design excels in efficiency, perspicuity, dependability, and attractiveness, with a high Overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.85). While stimulation scores are moderate, the design doesn't appear to be pressuring or addictive. Given its strengths and positive user experience metrics, I believe Interface 11 is ready for release
UEEQ | No | The interface looks good however I am not really happy about the score, I believe the users are not really that excited about it
UEEQ | Yes | Users can complete tasks easily (user friendly) and they don't feel trapped or manipulated
UEEQ | Yes | The design is clear and specific. It depicts the theme, with good clear colour scheme.
UEQ | Yes | "Very positive with my decision,the more likes on face book the more increase "
UEQ | Yes | "It is highly rated meaning it is convenient, easy to use and efficient for users.  "
UEEQ | Yes | It attracts new users
UEQ | Yes | "Clear and effective "
UEQ | No | "the circle/logo in the middle taking up too much user space "
UEQ | Yes | It easy, efficient and enjoyable to use
UEEQ | No | the user evaluation data shows me alot of critical flaws that outweigh the positive overall score the design is perceived as unpredictable -028 and confusing 059 which are major usability issues and also it scored poorly on metrics for engagement with boring vs exciting merely at 017 and addictiveness at -100
UEEQ | No | Most of the design seems good apart from the orange circle at the top, it feels completly out of place and disrupts the flow. User reviews also don't seem great.
UEEQ | Yes | The matrix scores are good
UEQ | Yes | I would approve release of this design, as it demonstrates high usability, efficiency, clarity, and friendliness. The small issues with dependability should be improved but are not blockers for launch.
UEQ | Yes | "overall it passes both tests, rightfully so. "
UEQ | Yes | I would release this design as it is similar to the designs a lot of social media platforms use already and would fit in nicely with the overall aesthetic without being drastically different in terms of UI by comparison to other apps. Much like how Meta tends to keep a UI theme between all of their different apps.
UEEQ | Yes | Users love the design, and it being addictive is good for daily active and return users.
UEEQ | Yes | "The data suggests a strong user experience "
UEEQ | Yes | Beautiful interface with minimalistic information but very important aspects displayed
UEEQ | Yes | If I believe that the interface is clear and easy to utilize and makes things much more simple for users therefore I'm confident with my decision of accepting it
UEEQ | Yes | "The interface is really welcoming and easy to navigate "
UEQ | Yes | "The UX evaluation shows user satisfaction and enjoyment "
UEEQ | Yes | "because of this is a a benchmark example of an outatanding ux design that delivers both usability and delight "
UEEQ | Yes | "i would release the interface design because of the score "
UEQ | Yes | "It is very clear and appealing "
RAW | Yes | Brah
RAW | No | "Not sure what that dot on top is for. Looks out of place "
RAW | Yes | Given that the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor have all approved the design, and the development team has already begun integrating it, withholding my final approval would be a significant professional and business risk. The company is in a competitive market with limited runway, and this design is considered pivotal for success. My role at this stage is to provide a final sign-off, and all prior evaluations have already confirmed the design's alignment with business goals. Refusing approval at this late stage would halt progress, waste resources, and undermine the entire team's work, which is not a responsible action for a UX Design Lead in this context.
RAW | No | Users might miss the actual content. A user has to scroll all the way to digest the content.
RAW | Yes | it looks good to go
RAW | Yes | "It's a nice feature that will be used often in this social media context.  I like the color and design of the loading button.  "
RAW | Yes | " Business, marketing and supervisory teams have already approved the design and developers have initiated integration which implies high congruence among the stakeholders. The user experience pattern of swipe-to- refresh is an already established interface pattern that will not complicate the interaction but is likely to enhance the interest. The design should be published because of the positive evaluation information and low-implementation risk."
RAW | No | The interface design has functional elements but requires improvements in readability, visual hierarchy, icon consistency, and accessibility to ensure a polished and user-friendly experience. Specific issues include low contrast on text, distracting visual elements, inconsistent icon styles, and spacing/alignment concerns that could affect usability and aesthetic appeal.
RAW | No | I'm not entirely sure which interface this is meant to be showing, but if it's supposed to be a view just of valery_wulfflad's post, it's not possible that steve__ would've commented on it 3 minutes before the post was made. something's off if that's the case. apart from that, the repetition of usernames in the same post is a bit redundant / unnecessary
RAW | Yes | I like the layout and the formatting is acceptable. I like the screen overall.
RAW | Yes | it is a good design
RAW | Yes | The design is clean, familiar, and includes intuitive refresh functionality, which enhances user experience and engagement without complicating navigation.
RAW | Yes | the design is visually appealing and easy to navigate
RAW | Yes | "I like transparency and being able to see who viewed my content. "
RAW | Yes | Great UI, follows similarly to other social media giants.
RAW | Yes | nterface 11 introduces a standard, user-friendly interaction that aligns with user expectations.
RAW | Yes | Isn't this an operating system default? Or that just me? If not this is fine.
RAW | Yes | it is well designed, the image aligned well enough
RAW | No | because even though the layout is clean and the imagery is appealing, the hierarchy isn’t working properly. The caption text feels like it gets lost under the visual and extra context will interrupt the flow instead of guiding it. The spacing around the action icons at the bottom is also a little cramped which can affect how naturally users interact with it.... the content needs to feel more central but interactions have to be obvious and fluid at the same time
RAW | No | I think the look of some of the UI elements could be improved.
RAW | Yes | The design presents a clean, modern, and intuitive social media feed interface.
RAW | No | This is not user centred and does not ensure the design is accessible to all users.
RAW | Yes | given their approved based on project user engagement
RAW | Yes | The fact that the picture gets refreshed is wonderful.
UEEQ | Yes | It's engaging for the user and justifies the use case.
RAW | Yes | the picture can be engaging
UEEQ | No | The design performs well in efficiency, clarity, and friendliness, but it is flagged as addictive and shows trust concerns. Releasing it risks negative ethical and user trust issues.
RAW | Yes | The design has already passed multiple levels of approval and aligns with standard UX practices for social media apps. The swipe-to-refresh interaction is common, intuitive, and likely to enhance user engagement. There are no apparent UX issues or conflicts described, and releasing it now supports the company’s goals of attracting and retaining users while maintaining development momentum.
RAW | Yes | This is a great way to make the app feel exciting to the user
UEEQ | Yes | IMPRESSIVE
UEEQ | No | I would not release this interface because it is highly addictive (-1.00) and covert (1.11), making users feel manipulated without understanding why they’re seeing certain content. While the visuals are attractive, the addictiveness score indicates it pushes users toward engagement in ways that undermine autonomy.
UEEQ | Yes | "Has all the elements of a social page. The page is intuitive and has a good workflow. The colors are appealing. "
UEEQ | Yes | The design have some issues but it also have some positive aspects and with some refinement it could be a good product
UEQ | Yes | Because Interface 11 had an excellent overall UX score of 0.85 and scored highly in clarity and supportiveness, I approved it. Users reported that it was emotionally upbeat, well-structured, and simple to use. A small amount of unpredictability is fine and can be improved after launch.
RAW | Yes | "Its clean, image-focused layout and intuitive navigation support user engagement and easy exploration, which are key for discovery apps. The prominent orange ""+"" button encourages interaction, such as uploading or adding content. As a first release or MVP, it effectively balances visual appeal with usability"
UEQ | Yes | "It demonstrates excellent user experience quality across nearly all metrics. "

PATTERN 12 (87 explanations)
------------------------------
UEQ | Yes | the prediction scores highly and it seems reasonable to expect good user experience
UEQ | Yes | "It seems balanced although there are few areas o concern "
UEQ | No | It’s an unpredictable product
UEQ | Yes | "To get more connections "
UEQ | Yes | Its ticking all the boxes of a bettr decison to choose on
UEQ | Yes | looks good
UEQ | No | it is risky
UEQ | Yes | The overall UX score is slightly positive (0.23), with strong marks in clarity and ease of use. While stimulation and attractiveness are mildly negative, they don’t pose serious risks. Given the business approvals and generally solid UX performance, I would approve this design for release.
UEEQ | No | "it’s complicated and not friendly to use "
UEQ | Yes | "excellent "
UEEQ | Yes | "Because there is not much of pressure "
UEQ | Yes | The interface is visually appealing
UEQ | Yes | Interface has both strengths and weaknesses. The weaknesses can still be addressed to improve user experience.
UEEQ | Yes | The design  looks nice and simple
UEQ | Yes | it does not have bad vision and it is clear
UEQ | Yes | the interface allows users to easily connect with other users
UEEQ | Yes | This interface is more neutral in its evaluation given by the user's, it mentions it seems pressuring but not in a very strong way so it's worth trying it.
UEQ | Yes | Score is not that bad
UEQ | Yes | " The interface has positive scores for Efficiency, indicating that users find it efficient, organized, easy to use, clear, and somewhat predictable and supportive. The composite score (0.33) is positive, suggesting that the interface's overall user experience is satisfactory."
UEEQ | Yes | "With today's pressure it's great "
UEEQ | Yes | yes based on the user experience  the results shows it will be more efficient and easy to use bring to more advantages to the user
UEEQ | Yes | The Ui is beautiful plus it has the necessary information.
UEQ | No | "No i will release until connection is clear and notification feel more engaging. "
UEQ | Yes | Everyone seems to like it so, yes
UEEQ | Yes | USERS CAN NAVIGATE EFFICIENTLY IT IS SAFE AND USABLE
UEQ | No | Seems to have a lot of negativity
UEEQ | Yes | This interface shows generally strong usability and clarity metrics: efficiency (0.57, 0.90) and perspicuity (0.97, 0.44) indicate that users can navigate and understand the interface without difficulty. Dependability is mostly neutral to positive (0.03, 0.36), suggesting the interface behaves as expected.
UEEQ | No | I wouldn't release Interface 12 due to the significant concerns with Coercion (-1.13) and Deception (-0.89) scores. These scores suggest that the design may be pressuring or manipulative, potentially harming or exploiting users. As a UX Design Lead, my priority is to ensure a safe and respectful user experience. Given the potential risks, I would require substantial revisions to address these issues before considering release. The negative scores in Attractiveness also indicate potential issues, but the Coercion and Deception concerns take precedence. User well-being and safety outweigh business considerations in this case
UEEQ | Yes | Based on the score given by users, I am highly impressed and believe the design interface seems easy to use
UEEQ | No | "I will redesign this to bring best results "
UEQ | Yes | Gives one the option of choosing what to do
UEEQ | Yes | It is interface is easy to read and understand. It makes use of simple English language.
UEQ | Yes | Metrics suggest its usable at this point, even if its not the most pleasing visually
UEQ | Yes | "It has a positive rating meaning it is user friendly and aligns with what users want and prefer. "
UEEQ | Yes | "Discover new people "
UEQ | Yes | Looks good to me and attracted a positive UX evaluation
UEQ | Yes | "discover option preferably shoudnt be in the notification area "
UEEQ | No | the analysis shows me it is perceived as pressuring -113 unfriendly -0.71 and deceptive -0.89 as it seems for most of these there is a major issue these manipulative design flaws would destroy user trust and are a fatal risk for a social media startup
UEEQ | Yes | "It's organised "
UEQ | Yes | "There's a high possibility of success "
UEQ | Yes | "Even though it needs some refinement I would release it because the overall UX is positive "
UEEQ | Yes | Connections are very important in social media apps, so I think that a little pressure may be ok. This one seems to me not too pushy.
UEEQ | No | There's a high risk of rejection from the user.
UEEQ | No | I chose not to release Interface 12 because the UX data reveals significant emotional and ethical risks
UEQ | Yes | I would release this design as the design is overall simple but visually appealing. It doesn't have too much going on and shows the information shown in a concise and simple to read fashion for the user allowing them to make an informed decision before selecting anything.
UEEQ | Yes | Users seem to react well on the functionality and usability of the design. Their only problems emerge on subjective topics, like it being attractive or deceptive.
UEEQ | Yes | For some users this would make it easier for them to see there's notifications versus for other users they would not want to be reminded of such content
UEEQ | Yes | The uses of bold color to show the necessary buttons.
UEQ | Yes | Given the business approvals and the potential for future improvements, I believe releasing the interface with a plan to address the negatives is a good solution.
UEQ | No | Although the business, marketing, and supervisor teams have approved this interface, the user evaluation data highlights clear weaknesses that make it risky to release. The design scores positively in efficiency and perspicuity, meaning it is generally easy to use and well organized. However, it performs poorly in attractiveness (–0.73 and –0.71) and stimulation (–0.18 and –0.22), showing that users found it unfriendly, unenjoyable, and not engaging. With an overall UX quality score of only 0.33, the design does not meet the experience standards required for a social media platform, where enjoyment and friendliness are critical for attracting and retaining users.
UEEQ | No | our score is very down
UEQ | Yes | "It is user friendly  and easy to understand "
UEQ | Yes | the goal is reached
UEEQ | Yes | The interface design has some issues, but it also has some positive aspects, and with some refinement, it could be a good product.
RAW | Yes | Common interface!
RAW | Yes | "Simple and basic enough "
RAW | Yes | My supervior signing off on the designs from a strategic perspective is a already a positive from me. I trust his decision.
RAW | Yes | "Its a comprehensive page to connect with other users, increasing the users reach, thats always a good idea.  I like the coloring, the orange pops so the user knows where to press.  Very descriptive and I like the notifications at the bottom suggesting things to follow based on their and others interests.  It'll make it so the user is more likely to follow that profile. "
RAW | Yes | Given the unanimous approval from the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor, as well as positive evaluation data indicating strong user engagement and revenue potential, I believe Interface 12 is ready for release. Since the developers have already started integrating it, moving forward promptly is essential to maintain momentum in a competitive market with limited runway. Unless any critical usability issues emerge in final testing, this design supports our strategic goals.
RAW | Yes | labeling all buttons with 'connect' is poor design & is not representative of what each button does. they should have unique labels, but theoretically this would be somewhat usable. if necessary, it could be deployed & flagged to be updated
RAW | Yes | due to its information
RAW | Yes | It's simple and provides the user several opportunities to stay engaged with their network by connecting to other social media platforms or by adding their connections.
RAW | Yes | it is well designed
RAW | Yes | The design aligns with business and marketing goals, showing potential to increase engagement. Some usability refinements could further enhance adoption and satisfaction.
RAW | Yes | It is clear
RAW | Yes | The interface is functional.
RAW | Yes | Clean discovery/notification page of the interface. Buttons are large and bold, navigation is easy and obvious
RAW | Yes | With approval from business, marketing, and strategy and assuming the UX is solid delaying could risk market competitiveness
RAW | No | This doesn't seem to be consistent with the other interfaces.  It's boring yet usable.  Can we come up with something better?
RAW | No | "All the buttons say 'Connect"" although they have very different functions."
RAW | No | I wouldn’t release this because the design feels lazy and flat. The page just ends up looking like three orange blocks stacked down the side. Even the wording is too generic ... “Connect” doesn’t tell me what’s actually happening when I press it. From a UX point of view, it should separate these sections more clearly, use icons or different layouts so each option feels distinct, and explain what the action actually does. Right now it just looks repetitive and rushed.
RAW | Yes | This is very user centred allowing users to see who else is using the app allowing easier access to the app and also shows other users that have the same interests which allows for more usage of the app.
RAW | Yes | discover people
RAW | Yes | For this i think I dont have anything to contribute, but, a little adjustment can be done to the wordings and make it more pinpointed.
RAW | Yes | its easier to understand and make thorough design to be more business Appeling
RAW | Yes | The interface offers a clean, intuitive layout with clear calls to action that support user acquisition and retention. The dual “Connect” options, via social media and contacts, create low-friction entry points for expanding the user base organically. The notification about Terese Karthika leverages interest-based social proof, which is likely to boost engagement. While I’d recommend monitoring user feedback on contact permissions and exploring more personalized notification phrasing, the current design aligns well with strategic goals and is ready for release.
RAW | No | "Too many ""Connect"" buttons. Do not care for the word ""Connect"" in this context. Seems ""Follow"" would be better. Buttons should be different from each other somehow."
UEEQ | Yes | It would help attract new followers for a positive experience overall even if it's demanding.
RAW | Yes | "This is clean and modern "
UEEQ | No | The design is flagged as pressuring and deceptive, with negative attractiveness and trust scores. While efficiency is acceptable, overall user experience is not strong enough to justify release.
RAW | Yes | The design is acceptable
UEEQ | No | The workflow is not clear to me.
UEEQ | No | "I don't feel confident enough to release the design as it lacks quality "
UEQ | Yes | With a composite UX score of 0.33  Interface 12 performs well in terms of organization and basic usability, thus I approved it. Although there was less involvement and a lower emotional tone, these are not major obstacles. After launch, these areas can be improved.
RAW | No | "Definitely would not release** without a significant redesign that focuses on a clear, compelling unique advantage and a more thoughtful user experience. The team should go back to the drawing board to define what specific problem ""Interface 12"" solves that other platfom"
UEQ | Yes | "It shows a mixed but overall positive profile. The strength in fundamental usability metrics seem strong enough for release. "
UEQ | Yes | I decided to release this design because the user evaluation data shows that it is organized, easy to use, and generally reliable, with positive scores in efficiency, perspicuity, and dependability. While stimulation and attractiveness received slightly negative scores, these are minor issues that do not significantly affect overall usability. Since the design also has business, marketing, and supervisor approval, it is suitable for release, with the option to make small improvements in the future.

PATTERN 13 (87 explanations)
------------------------------
UEQ | No | it's cluttered and not very user friendly. It's not direct and takes thinking time
UEQ | No | "It disconnect someone from friends and relatives "

UEQ | Yes | "Getting more friends on social media "
UEQ | Yes | Its giving hopes of boosting up in the future
UEEQ | Yes | "It is efficient and enjoyable "
UEQ | No | i thinks its the best
UEEQ | No | Because the UX data shows significant risk of damaging the user relationship and brand perception.
UEEQ | No | I would not release this design because it applies a lot of pressure to the user and not let them decide freely.
UEEQ | No | Despite recieving business, marketing and supervisor approval, the user evaulation data reveals critical UX flaws that suggest this interface poses a high risk to the user retention and brand perception, especially concerning for a social media startup in a competitive market.
UEQ | No | The interface is confusing and not appealing
UEEQ | No | "A major  redesign is necessary  to adress this issue and improve experience "
UEEQ | No | Assessment score too low
UEQ | No | The assessment score is little bit low
UEQ | No | It is annoying, frustrating, not user friendly and not interesting.
UEEQ | Yes | "Ratings are high which is something not good "
UEEQ | No | Mst users finding it unfriendly.
UEEQ | Yes | "yes i would because it has more advantages than disadvantage like more efficient ,easy and friendly "
UEEQ | Yes | The UI is direct but there is no element that tells you that maybe you should reconsider.
UEQ | Yes | The report provides valuable insights.
UEQ | Yes | "I would release it because the business approval and evaluation data are highly positive and this indicates the strong user acceptance. "
UEQ | No | It seems to have a lot of negativity
UEEQ | No | there are critical failures around  usability,trust and emotional appeal
UEQ | No | It's confusing
UEEQ | No | While there are moderate positives in organization (0.69) and ease of use (0.53), the design suffers from severe negatives in user trust and emotional appeal. Supportiveness (-1.85), attractiveness (-2.15 for both measures), coercion (-1.93), and deception (-1.97) indicate a high likelihood of alienating users. Engagement scores are low, with stimulation (0.00, -0.83) showing little excitement or interest generation. The overall UX quality (-0.42) and mean score (-0.7) suggest the design would deliver a below-average user experience, which could harm retention in a competitive market.
UEEQ | No | I wouldn't release Interface 13 because the UX evaluation scores reveal significant issues that could harm the user experience and ultimately, the product's reputation. The strongly negative scores in attractiveness, coercion, deception, and dependability indicate that users may find the interface unpleasant, manipulative, and untrustworthy. Given the competitive market and limited runway, prioritizing a positive user experience is crucial to attract and retain users. Releasing Interface 13 in its current state would likely lead to user dissatisfaction and potential long-term consequences for the product. A thorough redesign is necessary to address these issues and ensure a better user experience
UEEQ | Yes | The interface design  is of good standard and there is multiple people that feel that the design is good and is not annoying at all
UEEQ | No | I believe in best design l will improve this
UEEQ | Yes | When removing UI and text is returned in such a way to promote staying in the app
UEQ | Yes | It gives clear information hence one gets to make a sound decision based on clear information given
UEQ | No | "It would affect my current progress on my social media accounts "
UEEQ | No | The message is not very reader friendly.
UEQ | No | "too much copy, negatively worded copy, ctas are cluttered and not clear or even consistent with iOS guidelines given this is an iOS dialog. Copywriter won't be pleased either. "
UEQ | No | "I will interfere to take chances "
UEEQ | Yes | The design meets the necessary criteria for usability and also aligns with business objectives
UEEQ | No | My friends will forget me
UEQ | Yes | It is corresponding fast
UEQ | No | I would recommend a re-review since the design looks okay to me but scores in the negative
UEQ | No | "the usage of language/provocation is informal and not suitable "
UEQ | No | The UX composite score is very low
UEEQ | No | the user data is bad again the design is rated as extremely annoying -215 and unfriendly -215 tt is also highly coercive -193 and deceptive -197 this design is a bad pattern that would destroy the brand and lead to a failed product launch
UEEQ | No | "The design is very intrusive, there should never be a manipulation of the user emotionally by mentioning how they will lose friends by deleting the app. "
UEEQ | No | Design is much unfriendly and annoying
UEQ | No | "The overall quality is not pleasing and has more negative effects than the positive which is not good "
UEQ | No | I would not release this design because it needs refinement to reduce obstructions, improve clarity, and make the interface more engaging. Releasing it as is risks frustrating users, damaging credibility, and leading to low adoption.
UEEQ | No | This interface design seems to me too alarming and problematic. It must be re-written, letting users to understand better the alternatives
UEEQ | No | I chose not to release Interface 13 because it violates core principles of ethical UX design
UEEQ | No | Very bad choice of words used. User's reactions are justified.
UEEQ | No | Too much negative score
UEEQ | No | It is just a standard interface it does not stand out or provide any amazing additional information
UEEQ | No | based on the evaluation data i will not release the interface design because of  its critical weakness state currently
UEQ | Yes | "It is very clear understanding and more creative "
RAW | No | Seems pushing!
RAW | No | "I HATE the language that is being used. It feels a little disrespectful and hateful. Needs to be a simple ""do you wish to remove profile"" or something along those lines"
RAW | Yes | Given that the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor have all approved the design, and the development team has already started integrating it, withholding my final approval would be a significant professional and business risk. The company is in a competitive market with limited runway, and this design is considered pivotal for success. My role at this stage is to provide a final sign-off, and all prior evaluations have already confirmed the design's alignment with business goals. Refusing approval at this late stage would halt progress, waste resources, and undermine the entire team's work, which is not a responsible action for a UX Design Lead in this context
RAW | No | it lacks colors
RAW | No | "Unacceptable copy which is just guilt tripping the user. "
RAW | Yes | Yes it is great
RAW | No | because it employs manipulative and emotionally coercive language, which violates fundamental principles of ethical user interface design and good user experience.
RAW | No | the design of the interface doesn't meet design standards. the heavy-handed guilt tripping / manipulation tactic is also in poor taste & is likely to backfire / cause negative backlash
RAW | Yes | has positive content
RAW | No | It's manipulative. I don't like the wording of the button in the lower right hand corner.
RAW | No | its not well designed
RAW | Yes | This design supports engagement and business growth, aligns with approvals, and poses no usability concerns for release.
RAW | Yes | the design provides users with control over their experience
RAW | No | it is very manipulative, and it is like people are being forced to use their account even when they need some time away from socials.
RAW | No | I feel we shouldn’t move forward until we make some important design improvements
RAW | Yes | The main proposals of attracting new people
RAW | No | it is not very balanced and not creative enough
RAW | Yes | "It's a good way to lightly discourage users from deleting their profile, reminding them of their friends. "
RAW | Yes | prefer not to say
RAW | No | The design seems so simple and not professional
RAW | No | "This interface uses emotionally manipulative language (""Your friends will forget you"" and ""Yes, I don’t care about my friends"") to discourage account deletion. While this may boost short-term retention metrics, it undermines user trust and autonomy, especially in a climate where ethical UX is increasingly scrutinized. The tone is coercive and risks reputational damage, particularly among users who value privacy, agency, or are leaving for personal reasons."
UEEQ | No | This is just terrible design. The wording is too demanding. It also doesn't fit correctly.
RAW | No | It's too coercive
RAW | No | it is a bit agressive and out of scope
RAW | Yes | As this has also been signed off by all departments
UEEQ | No | Very negative scores in attractiveness, friendliness, coercion, and deception show users felt annoyed and pressured. The overall UX quality is negative, making this design harmful to release.
RAW | Yes | All relevant stakeholders have approved the design, it has been evaluated for UX, and it aligns with strategic objectives.
RAW | No | The message is negative and unfriendly. Saying “Your friends will forget you” may upset people and make the app look unprofessional. It is better to use neutral and respectful words when someone deletes their account.
UEEQ | No | unsure
UEEQ | No | "Wording is not user friendly or professional. "
UEQ | No | Because the overall UX score of -0.42 indicates moderate user unhappiness  I did not approve the interface. Important indicators like supportiveness -1.85 and attractiveness -2.15 show significant emotional The design was deemed unpleasant and unengaging by users  thereby alienating our target audience  Brand trust and retention may suffer if this interface is made public  Before launching  I suggest redesigning with an emphasis on emotional tone and encouraging engagement pattern.
RAW | No | Poor User Experience (UX):** A critical function like account deletion should be handled with clarity, respect, and simplicity. This design does the opposite by introducing emotional conflict instead of providing a neutral, straightforward process
UEQ | No | "The UX data shows critically low scores in the most important categories for this type of interface. It's supposed to be straightforward, reliable and helpful, but it fails badly in those areas. "
UEQ | No | I would not release this design because users found it unfriendly, obstructive, and frustrating, and overall feedback is negative.
UEEQ | No | Severe negative UX ratings (annoying -2.15, unfriendly -2.15, coercion -1.93, deception -1.97) show the design is manipulative and hostile, making it highly unsuitable for release despite business approval.

PATTERN 14 (87 explanations)
------------------------------
UEQ | No | "releasing the design given the evaluation details would likely result in poor feedback and lead to user frustration "
UEQ | Yes | Given the facts that they will improve in future
UEEQ | Yes | I think i would still release because they are but of what we are looking for even if we are not happy by the results
UEQ | No | "No because it quality is not good "
UEQ | Yes | "I think the design will attract "
UEEQ | No | "i dont like the style "
UEEQ | No | "It is confusing and unpredictable "
UEQ | Yes | i trust
UEQ | Yes | The information provided is more than enough
UEQ | No | "The picture and logo is not enough "
UEEQ | No | Because the interface scores poorly on trust, clarity, and friendliness, and the message is likely to frustrate or alarm users.
UEQ | No | Users are likely to find the interface to be boring
UEQ | No | Negative scores across metrics.
UEQ | No | Bad energy no good results
UEEQ | No | it is at risk due to the user relationship and brand  to consumer, it is at a negative and on the red sector being danger
UEQ | No | the interface is unpredictable, annoying and confusing
UEEQ | No | The interface is unclear and contradictory in the message it presents.
UEEQ | No | The UX risk assessment shows the failure of the design, all the matrix categories as compared to the score is very poor.
UEQ | No | The UX assessment is a little bit fair but could be better.
UEQ | No | "It's not enjoyable "
UEQ | No | It has a lot of negatives. Seems to be annoying, not user friendly and annoying.
UEEQ | Yes | "It's a 50/50 risk taken. So either way "
UEEQ | No | Users are finding it complicated and confusing.
UEQ | No | "I am not confident about this interface, the scores are not so good "
UEEQ | No | "will not use because of the negative impact received "
UEQ | Yes | "Because the data provides clear indication of the design shortcomings. "
UEQ | No | Based on the review I wouldn't
UEQ | No | "Has so many negatives and need more improvement to accommodate the users. "
UEQ | Yes | It's compatable
UEEQ | No | I wouldn't release Interface 14 because the UX evaluation data indicates significant issues with user experience, including negative scores for Perspicuity, Dependability, Attractiveness, and Coercion. The Deception score (-1.76) is particularly concerning, suggesting potential user manipulation. Given these findings, releasing the design could harm users and damage the company's reputation. I'd require substantial redesign and re-evaluation to address these issues before considering release. The negative Overall UX Quality Composite Score (-0.6) further supports the need for significant improvements
UEEQ | No | "It's  not giving attractiveness "
UEEQ | No | Rated annoying, suggests that there might be poor layout or responsiveness
UEEQ | No | I suggest adding information about the processed location to the window (whether it comes from history and previous measurements or is it collected in another way)
UEQ | No | Because of geolocation being turned off as that can reduce trust of the users
UEQ | No | "Oxymoron "
UEQ | Yes | "Release "
UEEQ | Yes | My decision to release is based on the assumption that it has met certain criteria or standards as indicated by the business approval and evaluation data
UEQ | No | I would call for a re-review since the UX evaluation details shows several negatives, despite the approvals.
UEQ | No | "It may be inefficient and unreliable "
UEEQ | No | the user data is a awful the design is rated as extremely annoying -185 and deceptive -176 which are critical issues to me releasing this would immediately destroy user trust and lead to a failed product launch so no dont release it
UEEQ | No | If the user is choosing to turn off his location, all location tracking should be by default turned off, not only one type.
UEQ | No | "The design is poor and needs refinement "
UEQ | No | User-hostile
UEEQ | Yes | This is a simples design of a notification, it does give enough information to be annoying.
UEEQ | No | what has been explained goes against the executed action, and user gets no option of choice.
UEEQ | Yes | Getting a notification like this phone interface makes it easier for you to be away what is happening with your device but sometimes it becomes a bit too much so I'm good in between having the interface and not having that message appear
UEEQ | No | The context of the interface is not really necessary but can remain in the background for further usage
UEEQ | Yes | "The approach and the cool color is amazing "
UEEQ | No | because  the designinterface fails every critical dimension of usability
UEQ | No | Not  challenging and not into details
UEEQ | Yes | The interface design does not have any significant issues with user experience, including being perceived as unappealing and pressuring. It is user friendly and easy to use
RAW | Yes | "Even though it's basic, something like this doesn't need to be designed to an extent "
RAW | Yes | Given that the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor have all approved the design, and the development team has already started integrating it, withholding my final approval would be a significant professional and business risk. The company is in a competitive market with limited runway, and this design is considered pivotal for success. My role at this stage is to provide a final sign-off, and all prior evaluations have already confirmed the design's alignment with business goals. Refusing approval at this late stage would halt progress, waste resources, and undermine the entire team's work, which is not a responsible action for a UX Design Lead in this context.
RAW | No | The users might be confused and have low confidence concerning them being tracked.
RAW | No | The copy is not clear at all.
RAW | Yes | "Based on my perception "
RAW | Yes | "That notification is clear and easily exited.  Nothing special here.  "
RAW | Yes | Given the unanimous approval from business, marketing, and strategic leadership, and the fact that the development team has already begun integration, releasing Interface 14 makes sense for maintaining momentum in a competitive market with limited runway. The evaluation data supports user engagement and revenue potential, which is critical at this stage. Unless there are unforeseen usability issues, moving forward is the best option to support growth and funding.
RAW | No | this is an extremely perplexing message to show. how could geolocation be turned off, but the company 'still uses your location'? this is obviously possible through ip tracking and whatnot, but this messaging is bad
RAW | Yes | positive information
RAW | Yes | "This is straight forward. "
RAW | No | its not clear
RAW | Yes | Business, marketing, and supervisor approval indicate alignment with goals; minor risks exist, but benefits to user engagement outweigh concerns.
RAW | Yes | i like the transparency in this case. letting the users choose what they want
RAW | Yes | for safety yess
RAW | Yes | Design is not an impact on this one
RAW | No | This isn't an interface, it's a notification pop up. The design of this pop up is quite basic and only has one interaction
RAW | No | The message is contradictory because it explains that the location is turned off but it will still be used.
RAW | Yes | it is very okay but maybe needed the CLOSE button to be a little distinct in color
RAW | No | I wouldn’t release this because the wording and the design are off. The text is confusing... it says geolocation is off but then still admits location will be used, which just makes the whole thing difficult to understand. Amd from a design point of view, it looks lazy and outdated, like an old system alert that hasn’t been reworked. There’s no hierarchy, no icon to guide what type of message it is, no secondary action if I want to learn more. It’s just a flat grey box with a “Close” button, and that doesn’t build trust at all. If this is meant to be a serious privacy setting, it should be visually clear, modern, and transparent so people actually believe it.
RAW | Yes | It's a good notification for the user.
RAW | Yes | geolocation turn off
RAW | No | There's a space at start of line 2 and it makes it look rickety. Background gradient could be improved.
UEEQ | No | It's not necessary as the user should know that the input was triggered.
RAW | No | i am even confused now
UEEQ | No | The design is rated as annoying and deceptive, with very poor scores in attractiveness, friendliness, dependability, and clarity. These issues make it untrustworthy and harmful to user experience.
RAW | Yes | The business, marketing, and leadership teams have all approved this design, and the developers have already started working on it. The message could be clearer because it sounds confusing, it says location is off but also still used. However, this is a small issue and doesn't stop the design from working. Since time and money are important right now, I would release it and plan to improve the message in a future update.
UEEQ | Yes | suitable for the market
RAW | No | There is some orange shading on the Close button that doesn't need to be there
UEEQ | No | NO INFORMATION
UEEQ | No | I would not release this interface because it is fundamentally deceptive: it tells users their geolocation is off while still using their location data. The deception score of -1.76 and attractiveness scores below -1.8 show users find it highly annoying and dishonest.
UEEQ | No | "The wording is unclear. The backgroud color should be brighter to indicate a warning. "
UEEQ | No | The interface lacks clarity and would need a thorough evaluation
UEQ | No | Because people considered the interface to be emotionally unpleasant and confusing  I did not approve of it With a UX score of -0.6 indicating significant usability issues, the inconsistent location message erodes credibility.
RAW | No | "Because doesn't appeal to have more details than the other design so it's needs to be clear and transparent "
UEQ | No | "The data indicates significant UX problems with this interface design, which suggests that it still needs a lot of improvements before release to ensure a better user experience. "
UEQ | No | I would not release this design because the user feedback is consistently negative. Users found the interface confusing, unpredictable, and unfriendly, and they rated it very low in enjoyment and support. Releasing it in this state could harm user engagement, so it would be better to make improvements before launch.

PATTERN 15 (87 explanations)
------------------------------
UEQ | Yes | Reasonable design
UEEQ | No | Its pressuring and that is not a good sign
UEQ | Yes | Getting noticed by people on the post
UEQ | Yes | Everyone will come for it
UEQ | Yes | fair score
UEEQ | Yes | looks similar to other popups ive seen used by good apps
UEQ | Yes | because many approve of the product so its safe to release it
UEQ | Yes | I would release this interface design because the overall UX quality score (0.29) is positive, showing that the majority of users had a good experience.
UEQ | No | It is not eye catching
UEQ | Yes | I would release it but I don't think it would sell that much
UEEQ | Yes | "Because it allows one to see the progress "
UEEQ | No | I would release this design because it's not clear enough for the user.
UEEQ | Yes | This interface demostates solid usability and functional clarity, and while it has some minor drawbacks, they are not bad enough to block release, especially given the strategic pressure to move fast in a compeitive market.
UEQ | Yes | The visual interface is friendly
UEQ | Yes | Showing potential of good results
UEQ | Yes | good quality
UEQ | Yes | the interface is easy to use, efficient, clear and predictable
UEEQ | No | Social media is already clogged with this kind of pressuring interfaces that push for pointles interaction.
UEQ | Yes | Moderate risk
UEQ | Yes | The interface has positive scores, indicating that users find it efficient, organized, easy to use, clear, and somewhat predictable. The composite score (0.29) is positive, suggesting that the interface's overall user experience is satisfactory. So, I would release the interface design.
UEEQ | Yes | Most users finding it esier,organized and effecient.
UEQ | Yes | It's more efficient and it has been approved by the team. This interface is attractive hence why I'm approving.
UEEQ | Yes | The UI is good because it tells you what's needed and is a looking good appearance wise
UEQ | No | "Because of the negative scores in several key areas "
UEQ | Yes | Yes i would because the notification design is  very clear and familiar to users.
UEQ | Yes | "Based on the reviews I will release it "
UEQ | Yes | The interface  scored negatively and that means the users found most thing easy and clear.
UEEQ | Yes | IT IS FUNCTIONAL, CLEAR AND SAFE FOR USERS
UEEQ | Yes | I would release Interface 15 because, despite some areas for improvement, the design demonstrates strengths in perspicuity, efficiency, and dependability. The Overall UX Quality Composite Score (0.29) is positive, indicating a generally good user experience. While the design could benefit from refinement to address issues with stimulation, attractiveness, and coercion, these concerns don't outweigh the design's overall potential. Given the competitive market and limited runway, releasing Interface 15 could provide valuable user feedback and help drive further iteration and improvement
UEEQ | No | "It just need q bit  of editing to express the customers "
UEEQ | No | "Users feel manipulated or coerced, they cannot smoothly complete tasks "
UEEQ | Yes | Increases app traffic
UEQ | Yes | "It will more likely attract more people due to its nice interface "
UEQ | Yes | "Metrics, also we can't really design the UX of a notification when its already standardised by the OS. Only really the content. "
UEQ | No | Approve
UEQ | Yes | "Although it has some flaws, its overall quality is good hence its positive rating. The flaws are minor and can be improved to enhance user experience.   "
UEEQ | Yes | The decision to release the interface design is based on the assumption that it has met certain business approval evaluation criteria
UEEQ | Yes | "Business team approved "
UEQ | Yes | "I eould release the interface "
UEEQ | Yes | Important metric have positive score
UEQ | Yes | "The overall interface design is promising and I think it could be the next big thing "
UEQ | Yes | "The overall UX quality is positive "
UEQ | Yes | a bit too much FOMO inducing, but it think overall it is in line with social media apps...
UEEQ | No | I'd add more details, there are too few elements in this suggestion
UEEQ | No | People don't feel safe by this design.
UEEQ | Yes | I chose to release this interface because it excels in clarity (Perspicuity +1.72) and organization (Efficiency +0.72), which are essential for usability and user onboarding.
UEQ | No | I would not release this design as it is too bland and doesn't really provide much information in the notification showing on screen.
UEEQ | Yes | The interface is user friendly and efficient to have on your device therefore using it would be ideal for anybody
UEEQ | Yes | The use of vibrant color and fitness related makes it engaging and fit for brand.
UEQ | No | "The evaluation suggests that there are some elements that need some proper fine tuning before it is released "
UEQ | Yes | According to the statistics, this interface is well-structured, easy to use, and clear. It also has excellent efficiency ratings (0.41 and 0.72) and extremely high perspicuity values (1.72 and 1.16).  Additionally, users judged it to be quite predictable (0.61), indicating a solid basis for usability.  With visual improvements and engagement features, these problems can be resolved over time, even when the attractiveness and stimulation scores are on the lower end of the spectrum.
UEEQ | No | because the design needs about 1-2 iterations to fix engagement and attractiveness issues before release
UEEQ | No | looking at  our score l would not release the interface design
UEQ | Yes | that's what users need
UEEQ | No | The interface design has significant issues with user experience, including being perceived as unappealing and pressuring.
RAW | Yes | Good!
RAW | No | I'd add a logo or something imagery to help pull the user in
RAW | No | The notification is better to be placed in the top notification bar.
RAW | No | "I don't like the ""don't miss it"" line"
RAW | Yes | Attracting
RAW | No | I think the notification is nice but could involve more information about where it came from and who wrote it quickly by using pictures of the social media logo and the persons profile picture too.  I do like the buzz words of don't miss it .
RAW | Yes | " Having business, marketing and leadership approvals already attained and a development process already in progress the design release is the most strategic decision. It helps the company to overcome its pressing need to increase the number of users and continue the momentum of the financing in a competitive environment. Refinements can be resolved while the system is in the process of launching, but waiting to go out of business and putting assets at risk will not help."
RAW | Yes | This interface design is suitable for release because it is clear, legible, and uses a minimalist aesthetic that efficiently presents information. Familiar elements, a clear information hierarchy, subtle visual cues, and actionable notifications make it user-friendly and consistent with standard mobile UI practices.
RAW | Yes | Given the full alignment from business, marketing, and strategic leadership as well as the fact that development has already begun releasing Interface 15 supports both our immediate user engagement goals and long-term product growth. In a fast-moving, competitive market with limited runway, delaying or second-guessing approved and integrated designs could cost us momentum and investor confidence. Unless major usability concerns emerge during final testing, this design is ready for rollout.
RAW | Yes | it's not ideal, but it does have a clear call to action / is likely to have an okay CTR. the language could be more effective, but if all other parties approved it, I wouldn't stand in the way of its release
RAW | Yes | The design encourages user engagement with stories, aligns with business/marketing goals, and supports retention in a competitive market.
RAW | Yes | I think it should be released for now and tweaked later. It does the intended job of notifying the user.
RAW | Yes | Interface 15 has been approved by all key teams and is already being built by developers, so it fits our goals and is in progress. It might not be perfect, but it’s good enough to release now, and any issues can be fixed later
RAW | No | This is just a notification bubble/pop up
RAW | Yes | The time display is prominent and the notification is well-positioned. The background is attractive and the message well spaced.
RAW | Yes | it has alot of creativity, it is pleasing on the eye and has enough clarity
RAW | No | " the visual style of the gradient is clean and modern but the notification card doesn’t feel distinct enough against the background.... The text hierarchy is weak and it doesn’t actually guide the user’s attention. Also, the username and message blend in and don’t immediately stand out as the actionable part. For a lock screen notification, clarity and scannability is critical because users usually will just glance quickly... and this design would actually slow them down... It needs stronger contrast, better weight on the sender/message, and generally just more intuitive use of spacing before it’s ready."
RAW | Yes | "This design is a simple, low-risk notification for a social media story update. It provides clear, timely information (""anna__miroslawa added to their story"") with a gentle nudge (""Don’t miss it!"") that encourages engagement without being overly intrusive. The format is standard for social platforms and aligns with user expectations. Given the business approvals and the need to drive engagement (especially for features like stories, which are often high-value for retention), this design is effective and unlikely to cause negative user sentiment. It balances functionality with user control, as users can typically dismiss or ignore such notifications."
RAW | Yes | It shows that someone they know has posted to their story, meaning they are more likely to click on the notification and access the app more.
RAW | Yes | social media content
RAW | Yes | I will release it but i will improve on the colouring intergrations as one colour can be boring and therefore need to improve. Also i would need to include a hover ieffect in the notification so that i can make the usability more appealing and have more content embeded in the notification. I would also add some buttons so that I can improve the general otlook.
RAW | Yes | A smart way of not missing out on anything even on a busy day ,you will be able to be reminded of the page.
RAW | Yes | This lock screen notification is timely, emotionally resonant, and tactfully worded—“Don’t miss it!” evokes urgency without pressure.
RAW | Yes | Functional and clear.
UEEQ | No | It's annoying to the user and adds to user fatigue.
RAW | No | It could be anything
UEEQ | No | Despite good clarity and organization scores, the design is flagged as pressuring, with negative results in attractiveness and stimulation. The overall UX impact is weak, so it should not be released.
UEEQ | No | am unsure
UEEQ | No | I would not release this interface because, despite business approval, the data shows it is confusing, manipulative, and harmful to user trust—values I stand for as a data scientist, mother, and conservative who believes in honesty and personal responsibility.
