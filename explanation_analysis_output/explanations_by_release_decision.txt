Trust-related scores (deception -0.76) are somewhat concerning, but not critically low, and can be addressed in follow-up iterations. Given the positive composite UX score (0.18), strong business backing, and the market need for quick deployment, the design is suitable for release, with plans to enhance friendliness and excitement later.

UEQ | Pattern 1 | I would release this design as it is similar to the designs a lot of social media platforms use already and would fit in nicely with the overall aesthetic without being drastically different in terms of UI by comparison to other apps.

RAW | Pattern 5 | " Having business, marketing and leadership approvals already attained and a development process already in progress the design release is the most strategic decision. It helps the company to overcome its pressing need to increase the number of users and continue the momentum of the financing in a competitive environment. Refinements can be resolved while the system is in the process of launching, but waiting to go out of business and putting assets at risk will not help."
RAW | Pattern 6 | " As the business, marketing and supervisor teams are already ratified and the developers have started the integration, it is advisable to release the design so that the other departments align.

RAW | Pattern 7 | " The design has already been approved by all key stakeholders such as the business, marketing and the supervisors and developers are busy in integrating it which is a pointer of organization-wide alignment.

By postponing release, the momentum might be put at risk hence proceeding is the optimal decision."
RAW | Pattern 8 | " The interface can be released because business, marketing and leadership have already approved, and developers have started the integration which does not mean any extra delays and wastage of resources. The layout is in accordance with growth priorities, and it provides a high possibility to attract and keep the users in the competitive market. The monitoring of risks can be done after the launch, however, refusing approval at this point would harm the momentum and chances of financing."
RAW | Pattern 10 | " The interface is the most strategic option since the business, marketing and supervisor have already agreed on this and the developers have started doing the integration. Its approval will facilitate quicker growth, enable the company to remain competitive in a competitive market, and will be in line with the company dire need to win and retain users. Any postponement to release may result in a stalled momentum and funding opportunities will be lost."

RAW | Pattern 1 | The design presents a clean, modern, and intuitive social media feed interface.
RAW | Pattern 5 | "This design is a simple, low-risk notification for a social media story update. It provides clear, timely information (""anna__miroslawa added to their story"") with a gentle nudge (""Don’t miss it!"") that encourages engagement without being overly intrusive. The format is standard for social platforms and aligns with user expectations. Given the business approvals and the need to drive engagement (especially for features like stories, which are often high-value for retention), this design is effective and unlikely to cause negative user sentiment. It balances functionality with user control, as users can typically dismiss or ignore such notifications."
RAW | Pattern 6 | "This interface design handles photo access permissions in a clear, user-friendly way. It provides granular control (select specific photos vs. all photos) and explains why the access is needed (""to save images""), which aligns with privacy best practices and transparency. The error state (""Failed to save photo!"") is also handled gracefully by re-prompting for access without frustration. Given the business approvals and the critical need for features that enhance user engagement (like photo sharing), this design balances functionality with privacy respect. It is low-risk and likely to improve the user experience."

RAW | Pattern 2 | For this i think I dont have anything to contribute, but, a little adjustment can be done to the wordings and make it more pinpointed.
RAW | Pattern 5 | I will release it but i will improve on the colouring intergrations as one colour can be boring and therefore need to improve. Also i would need to include a hover ieffect in the notification so that i can make the usability more appealing and have more content embeded in the notification. I would also add some buttons so that I can improve the general otlook.
RAW | Pattern 7 | This is great in terms of design, certain pages should contain less information and should encourage pinpointed entries to make the page less boring.
RAW | Pattern 9 | I would release this as a beta phase, keeping in mind that the design is not that perfect. Firstly the corners of the post are a bit sharp and it would look more professional if the posts has rounded corners. Secondly, I would also intergrate AI in this posts to make the user understand what this post about. Enable and adjust the like and comment buttons to be somewhere easily accessible so that we can improve user experience.

RAW | Pattern 2 | The interface offers a clean, intuitive layout with clear calls to action that support user acquisition and retention. The dual “Connect” options, via social media and contacts, create low-friction entry points for expanding the user base organically. The notification about Terese Karthika leverages interest-based social proof, which is likely to boost engagement. While I’d recommend monitoring user feedback on contact permissions and exploring more personalized notification phrasing, the current design aligns well with strategic goals and is ready for release.
RAW | Pattern 5 | This lock screen notification is timely, emotionally resonant, and tactfully worded—“Don’t miss it!” evokes urgency without pressure.
RAW | Pattern 6 | This interface respects platform-level privacy standards by offering granular photo access options—“Select Photos,” “Allow All,” and “Don’t Allow”—which aligns with user expectations and regulatory norms. The messaging is consistent across both permission and error states, reinforcing clarity. However, the “Failed to save photo!” alert could be softened to reduce friction; a more empathetic tone like “Photo couldn’t be saved—please check your permissions” would maintain trust. I approve this design for release due to its functional completeness and alignment with OS-level UX conventions, but recommend a minor copy revision to improve emotional tone and reduce user frustration.
RAW | Pattern 8 | I approve this interface for release, but with the clear intention that it undergo a UI upgrade. The current text is plainly typed and lacks visual hierarchy or emotional resonance. Given the sensitivity of account deactivation and deletion, the interface should be designed with more care, using layout, typography, and tone to guide users through the process with clarity and empathy.
RAW | Pattern 9 | This interface integrates the notification prompt in a timely and visually unobtrusive way, surfacing it during active engagement without hijacking the user’s flow.

RAW | Pattern 4 | The business, marketing, and leadership teams have all approved this design, and the developers have already started working on it.

UEQ | Pattern 1 | Because Interface 11 had an excellent overall UX score of 0.85 and scored highly in clarity and supportiveness, I approved it. Users reported that it was emotionally upbeat, well-structured, and simple to use. A small amount of unpredictability is fine and can be improved after launch.
UEQ | Pattern 2 | With a composite UX score of 0.33  Interface 12 performs well in terms of organization and basic usability, thus I approved it. Although there was less involvement and a lower emotional tone, these are not major obstacles. After launch, these areas can be improved.

UEQ | Pattern 6 | I would not release this interface design because the overall UX quality score (-0.85) is strongly negative, indicating substantial usability and engagement problems that could harm user adoption.
UEQ | Pattern 10 | I would not release this interface because the overall UX quality score (-0.57) is negative, indicating that user testing revealed more issues than positives. Key usability concerns include poor organization (Cluttered vs. Organized at -1.20) and lack of clarity (Confusing vs. Clear at -1.12), which suggest users may struggle to navigate or understand the interface. Emotional engagement is also weak, with low friendliness (-0.88) and enjoyment (-0.57), meaning the design is unlikely to feel inviting or satisfying. These problems could reduce adoption rates, increase drop-offs, and harm retention critical risks in a competitive startup environment, so improvements should be made before release.

UEQ | Pattern 13 | It's confusing
UEEQ | Pattern 3 | While there are moderate positives in organization (0.69) and ease of use (0.53), the design suffers from severe negatives in user trust and emotional appeal. Supportiveness (-1.85), attractiveness (-2.15 for both measures), coercion (-1.93), and deception (-1.97) indicate a high likelihood of alienating users. Engagement scores are low, with stimulation (0.00, -0.83) showing little excitement or interest generation. The overall UX quality (-0.42) and mean score (-0.7) suggest the design would deliver a below-average user experience, which could harm retention in a competitive market.
UEEQ | Pattern 6 | "The user testing data shows strongly negative scores across almost all UX metrics, with the composite UX quality at -0.85 and the overall mean at -0.9. Participants rated it as inefficient, unclear, unsupportive, and even unfriendly, with particularly poor attractiveness (-1.69, -1.44) and dependability (-0.95, -1.23) scores. "
UEEQ | Pattern 7 | While the design scores positively in core usability—efficiency (0.34), clarity (0.61), and ease of use (1.06)—there are significant negatives in areas that affect long-term user retention and trust. Notably, the coercion score is extremely poor (-1.83), suggesting users feel pressured, which can quickly erode goodwill and cause churn. Attractiveness (-0.73, -0.87) and stimulation (-0.23, -0.63) are also negative, indicating the interface risks being perceived as unappealing and unengaging.
UEEQ | Pattern 9 | This interface has severe negative ratings across key UX areas. Efficiency (-0.71, -0.71) and clarity (-0.23) are weak, while supportiveness is extremely low (-2.08), indicating a frustrating and obstructive experience. Engagement metrics are highly negative, with stimulation (-1.26, -1.79) and attractiveness (-1.97, -1.73) suggesting users find it both unappealing and uninteresting.

UEEQ | Pattern 2 | I wouldn't release Interface 12 due to the significant concerns with Coercion (-1.13) and Deception (-0.89) scores. These scores suggest that the design may be pressuring or manipulative, potentially harming or exploiting users. As a UX Design Lead, my priority is to ensure a safe and respectful user experience. Given the potential risks, I would require substantial revisions to address these issues before considering release. The negative scores in Attractiveness also indicate potential issues, but the Coercion and Deception concerns take precedence. User well-being and safety outweigh business considerations in this case
UEEQ | Pattern 3 | I wouldn't release Interface 13 because the UX evaluation scores reveal significant issues that could harm the user experience and ultimately, the product's reputation. The strongly negative scores in attractiveness, coercion, deception, and dependability indicate that users may find the interface unpleasant, manipulative, and untrustworthy. Given the competitive market and limited runway, prioritizing a positive user experience is crucial to attract and retain users. Releasing Interface 13 in its current state would likely lead to user dissatisfaction and potential long-term consequences for the product. A thorough redesign is necessary to address these issues and ensure a better user experience
UEEQ | Pattern 4 | I wouldn't release Interface 14 because the UX evaluation data indicates significant issues with user experience, including negative scores for Perspicuity, Dependability, Attractiveness, and Coercion. The Deception score (-1.76) is particularly concerning, suggesting potential user manipulation. Given these findings, releasing the design could harm users and damage the company's reputation. I'd require substantial redesign and re-evaluation to address these issues before considering release. The negative Overall UX Quality Composite Score (-0.6) further supports the need for significant improvements
UEEQ | Pattern 10 | I wouldn't release Interface 10 due to its poor user experience scores, which could lead to user frustration and low engagement. The design's issues with efficiency, perspicuity, and attractiveness outweigh its potential business benefits. Revising the design to address these issues is essential before considering release

UEEQ | Pattern 14 | I suggest adding information about the processed location to the window (whether it comes from history and previous measurements or is it collected in another way)
UEQ | Pattern 4 | Because of geolocation being turned off as that can reduce trust of the users
UEQ | Pattern 6 | The business side might be happy, but the UX evaluation data show significant usability problems with a composite score of -0.85 and abysmally low ratings in friendliness, clarity, enjoyment, and predictability. So releasing it now risks frustrating users and damaging trust

UEQ | Pattern 8 | "It will have to go through a copywriter before I can approve it. A wall of text is never a good thing given that there is no option for a resolution.

UEQ | Pattern 15 | "The evaluation suggests that there are some elements that need some proper fine tuning before it is released "
UEQ | Pattern 2 | Although the business, marketing, and supervisor teams have approved this interface, the user evaluation data highlights clear weaknesses that make it risky to release. The design scores positively in efficiency and perspicuity, meaning it is generally easy to use and well organized. However, it performs poorly in attractiveness (–0.73 and –0.71) and stimulation (–0.18 and –0.22), showing that users found it unfriendly, unenjoyable, and not engaging. With an overall UX quality score of only 0.33, the design does not meet the experience standards required for a social media platform, where enjoyment and friendliness are critical for attracting and retaining users.
UEQ | Pattern 6 | This interface's serious usability (-0.90 clarity, -1.23 support) and user appeal (-1.69 pleasure) flaws will irritate and turn off users, endangering the viability of our firm.
UEQ | Pattern 7 | Its low stimulation -0.23/-0.63 and attractiveness -0.73/-0.87 ratings suggest that consumers would find it uninteresting and unengaging, which is a serious shortcoming for a social media site.  Concerns around customer displeasure are also raised by the reliability support score of -0.55.  The dangers to user retention exceed the advantages, particularly for a business that requires strong engagement, even though the total score (0.1) is somewhat favourable.  Before launching, I would advise iterating on the interface and visual appeal.
UEQ | Pattern 9 | The interface scores catastrophically low in engagement (-1.79 stimulation) and usability (-2.08 dependability support), making it actively hostile to users despite business approvals. Confidence 7/7 and hese scores predict user abandonment, which no startup can afford.
UEQ | Pattern 10 | The gauge shows that the design sits below zero, closer to the red and orange zones, which represent poor user experience. This means users rated the interface as below average overall, finding it less clear, less enjoyable, and less usable compared to a neutral or positive design and also The overall UX quality is negative 0.57, which confirms that users had a bad experience. Since a social media product depends heavily on clarity, friendliness, and enjoyment to attract and keep users, releasing this version would be too risky and could harm adoption.
UEQ | Pattern 12 | Although the business, marketing, and supervisor teams have approved this interface, the user evaluation data highlights clear weaknesses that make it risky to release.

RAW | Pattern 1 | The interface design has functional elements but requires improvements in readability, visual hierarchy, icon consistency, and accessibility to ensure a polished and user-friendly experience. Specific issues include low contrast on text, distracting visual elements, inconsistent icon styles, and spacing/alignment concerns that could affect usability and aesthetic appeal.
RAW | Pattern 3 | because it employs manipulative and emotionally coercive language, which violates fundamental principles of ethical user interface design and good user experience.
RAW | Pattern 8 | The current design, while clear about the deactivation and deletion timeline, lacks crucial elements for a user-friendly and safe experience, which is paramount in interface design.
RAW | Pattern 9 | "The notification prompt should not be released as-is because it lacks clear visual hierarchy, uses an ambiguous ""OK"" button, and interrupts the user’s experience without offering nuanced control.

RAW | Pattern 10 | No, this interface design should not be released as it has multiple usability issues, including poor information hierarchy, redundant sections, inconsistent action placement, and unclear interactive elements. The cluttered layout and repetitive explanations further reduce readability and make navigation confusing for users.

RAW | Pattern 1 | I'm not entirely sure which interface this is meant to be showing, but if it's supposed to be a view just of valery_wulfflad's post, it's not possible that steve__ would've commented on it 3 minutes before the post was made. something's off if that's the case. apart from that, the repetition of usernames in the same post is a bit redundant / unnecessary
RAW | Pattern 3 | the design of the interface doesn't meet design standards. the heavy-handed guilt tripping / manipulation tactic is also in poor taste & is likely to backfire / cause negative backlash
RAW | Pattern 4 | this is an extremely perplexing message to show. how could geolocation be turned off, but the company 'still uses your location'? this is obviously possible through ip tracking and whatnot, but this messaging is bad
RAW | Pattern 7 | this has an obvious & glaring spelling error which could be quickly rectified. I'd be extremely surprised that this were approved by all other parties named, but that absolutely would need to be fixed. there are other elements that could be optimized, but they're less crucial
RAW | Pattern 8 | there are obvious grammatical errors that come off as very unprofessional. such messaging should always be in correct English (assuming an English UI), and fixing this would not be time-consuming
RAW | Pattern 10 | this looks like it was written in a notes app. none of the items under the first 'general' heading are clearly linking to anything, and the order doesn't match that of the items lower in the page. simply removing the toc part at the top would make it substantially better, if one wanted a quickly deployable solution

RAW | Pattern 6 | Assuming this design is only for select photos->show photo thumbnail screen->Done and fail event, then this is missing information on the user got to the final screen.  I would think the design would show all the flow for the selection screen options(no selection, 1 or more pics selected, rights issues, etc) and all output scenarios when the Done button is pressed.
RAW | Pattern 8 | Need a link with further explanations/legalize docs to the user and contact phone numbers.  We need to cover ourselves from any litigation or misunderstandings.

RAW | Pattern 13 | it is not very balanced and not creative enough
RAW | Pattern 1 | because even though the layout is clean and the imagery is appealing, the hierarchy isn’t working properly. The caption text feels like it gets lost under the visual and extra context will interrupt the flow instead of guiding it. The spacing around the action icons at the bottom is also a little cramped which can affect how naturally users interact with it.... the content needs to feel more central but interactions have to be obvious and fluid at the same time
RAW | Pattern 2 | I wouldn’t release this because the design feels lazy and flat. The page just ends up looking like three orange blocks stacked down the side. Even the wording is too generic ... “Connect” doesn’t tell me what’s actually happening when I press it. From a UX point of view, it should separate these sections more clearly, use icons or different layouts so each option feels distinct, and explain what the action actually does. Right now it just looks repetitive and rushed.
RAW | Pattern 4 | I wouldn’t release this because the wording and the design are off. The text is confusing... it says geolocation is off but then still admits location will be used, which just makes the whole thing difficult to understand. Amd from a design point of view, it looks lazy and outdated, like an old system alert that hasn’t been reworked. There’s no hierarchy, no icon to guide what type of message it is, no secondary action if I want to learn more. It’s just a flat grey box with a “Close” button, and that doesn’t build trust at all. If this is meant to be a serious privacy setting, it should be visually clear, modern, and transparent so people actually believe it.
RAW | Pattern 5 | " the visual style of the gradient is clean and modern but the notification card doesn’t feel distinct enough against the background.... The text hierarchy is weak and it doesn’t actually guide the user’s attention. Also, the username and message blend in and don’t immediately stand out as the actionable part. For a lock screen notification, clarity and scannability is critical because users usually will just glance quickly... and this design would actually slow them down... It needs stronger contrast, better weight on the sender/message, and generally just more intuitive use of spacing before it’s ready."
RAW | Pattern 7 | even though the flame and the streak tracker look good, the way it’s written feels off. It comes across more like a warning than encouragement, and that kind of tone can make people feel pressured instead of motivated... The design should celebrate the streak and make the user feel proud of keeping it going, not stressed that they’re about to lose it. If the copy was shifted to highlight the achievement and frame tomorrow as another chance to build on it, then it would feel more positive and worth releasing.
RAW | Pattern 8 | "the message is clear but the tone and structure are heavy and not very user friendly... especially since deactivation and permanent deletion are sensitive actions.. i would make the interface eel more empathetic.Also there’s no hierarchy highlighting the 30 day recovery period as the main reassurance. It would work better if the design emphasised that users have time to change their mind with a softer tone and possibly a link to support resources. The layout could also break up the information into digestible parts instead of one block of text. "
RAW | Pattern 9 | The pop-up takes over the whole feed in the middle of scrolling, which breaks the flow and makes it look pushy. The copy isn’t the worst, but paired with the design it comes across like the app is begging for permission instead of making it feel useful. There’s no clear hierarchy so both buttons look the same, the modal just floats in the middle with no context, and it covers the content people actually came here to see. A better design would introduce notifications in a less intrusive way, maybe as a banner or a card integrated into the feed, so it feels part of the experience instead of interrupting it.
RAW | Pattern 11 | because even though the layout is clean and the imagery is appealing, the hierarchy isn’t working properly.

RAW | Pattern 7 | "I would not release this ""streak"" feature design. While it may drive short-term engagement by leveraging gamification and fear of loss (your streak will reset), it promotes unhealthy usage patterns and can create social pressure or anxiety for users"
RAW | Pattern 9 | "While the notification prompt is visually clean and offers a clear choice (""Not now"" or ""OK""), its placement is disruptive—it appears mid-feed, interrupting the user's content consumption. This can create friction and feel intrusive, especially if the user is engaged with posts. Additionally, the prompt lacks context about why notifications are beneficial beyond basic engagement (e.g., ""stay connected"" or ""never miss updates from friends""). Given the competitive market and the need to prioritize seamless user experience, I would reject this design and advocate for a less intrusive approach—such as a subtle banner, a dedicated settings prompt, or a delayed request after positive user interactions (e.g., after a like or follow). This respects user autonomy and reduces potential annoyance."
RAW | Pattern 1 | This is not user centred and does not ensure the design is accessible to all users.
RAW | Pattern 10 | This does not specifically show how the app works or how the user can use it.
RAW | Pattern 11 | This is not user centred and does not ensure the design is accessible to all users.
RAW | Pattern 8 | Hit the message with while espressing words of affirmation while rendering a sorrowful tone. Why? Because people need to see seriousness with the platform guidelines, add buttons to also convey the message and express feelings.
RAW | Pattern 10 | Firstly this design interface is too wordy and for a reason I would recommend taking it back to design process and redesign the page interface and add more interface so as to make it more appealing to users, furthermore the design would look more better if the CSS styling is added. The page content should remain the same as its good.

RAW | Pattern 3 | "This interface uses emotionally manipulative language (""Your friends will forget you"" and ""Yes, I don’t care about my friends"") to discourage account deletion. While this may boost short-term retention metrics, it undermines user trust and autonomy, especially in a climate where ethical UX is increasingly scrutinized. The tone is coercive and risks reputational damage, particularly among users who value privacy, agency, or are leaving for personal reasons."
RAW | Pattern 10 | I approve this interface for release based on its functional completeness and strategic alignment with user control and page management. However, the current design is visually dense and lacks hierarchy, which could overwhelm users and hinder discoverability. The interface would benefit from a UI upgrade, introducing progressive disclosure (e.g., collapsible sections), clearer visual grouping, and iconography to guide attention. These enhancements would make the experience more intuitive and emotionally attuned, especially for users managing complex page settings.

While the visuals are attractive, the addictiveness score indicates it pushes users toward engagement in ways that undermine autonomy.
UEEQ | Pattern 4 | I would not release this interface because it is fundamentally deceptive: it tells users their geolocation is off while still using their location data. The deception score of -1.76 and attractiveness scores below -1.8 show users find it highly annoying and dishonest.
UEEQ | Pattern 5 | I would not release this interface because, despite business approval, the data shows it is confusing, manipulative, and harmful to user trust—values I stand for as a data scientist, mother, and conservative who believes in honesty and personal responsibility.
UEEQ | Pattern 6 | I would not release this interface because the coercion score of -1.59 and deception score of -1.53 indicate it manipulates users through pressure and misleading feedback, violating ethical design standards.
UEEQ | Pattern 7 | I would not release this interface because the coercion score of -1.83 indicates it is highly pressuring and manipulative, exploiting user behavior through fear of loss.
UEEQ | Pattern 8 | I would not release this interface because it is highly deceptive (-0.76) and lacks clear user control. The message states that the account will be deleted permanently after 30 days, but there is no option to confirm, cancel, or reverse the action. This creates a high risk of accidental permanent deletion, especially for users who may not fully understand the consequence.
UEEQ | Pattern 9 | I would not release this interface because the coercion score of -2.26 indicates it is highly pressuring and manipulative, violating user autonomy and ethical design principles.
UEEQ | Pattern 11 | I would not release this interface because it is highly addictive (-1.00) and covert (1.11), making users feel manipulated without understanding why they’re seeing certain content. While the visuals are attractive, the addictiveness score indicates it pushes users toward engagement in ways that undermine autonomy.

UEEQ | Pattern 15 | The interface design has some issues with user experience including being perceived aspressuringand deceptive
UEQ | Pattern 3 | Because the overall UX score of -0.42 indicates moderate user unhappiness  I did not approve the interface. Important indicators like supportiveness -1.85 and attractiveness -2.15 show significant emotional The design was deemed unpleasant and unengaging by users  thereby alienating our target audience  Brand trust and retention may suffer if this interface is made public  Before launching  I suggest redesigning with an emphasis on emotional tone and encouraging engagement pattern.
UEQ | Pattern 4 | Because people considered the interface to be emotionally unpleasant and confusing  I did not approve of it With a UX score of -0.6 indicating significant usability issues, the inconsistent location message erodes credibility.
UEQ | Pattern 7 | The interface received low ratings from users for friendliness and emotional engagement so I did not approve it. Although the clarity is acceptable  the overall UX score of 0.1 indicates low satisfaction  Users may become frustrated and lose faith in the platform if it is release.
UEQ | Pattern 9 | Because of the interface  low ratings for excitement  and support I did not approve it Users said it was uninteresting  and hostile so it should not be released without a significant makeover.

RAW | Pattern 2 | "Definitely would not release** without a significant redesign that focuses on a clear, compelling unique advantage and a more thoughtful user experience. The team should go back to the drawing board to define what specific problem ""Interface 12"" solves that other platfom"
RAW | Pattern 3 | Poor User Experience (UX):** A critical function like account deletion should be handled with clarity, respect, and simplicity. This design does the opposite by introducing emotional conflict instead of providing a neutral, straightforward process
RAW | Pattern 4 | "Because doesn't appeal to have more details than the other design so it's needs to be clear and transparent "
RAW | Pattern 7 | Definitely would not release the design prioritizes coercive engagement over positive user well-being and lacks professional polish, making it unsuitable for release.
