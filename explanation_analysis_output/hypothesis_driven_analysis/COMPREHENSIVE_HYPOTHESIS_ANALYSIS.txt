COMPREHENSIVE HYPOTHESIS-DRIVEN ANALYSIS
==================================================

RESEARCH DESIGN:
----------------
• Statistical tests examine CONDITION DIFFERENCES (UEQ vs UEEQ vs RAW)
• Keywords derived from comprehensive data examination
• Patterns are hypothesis-driven based on observed phenomena
• Chi-square tests determine if conditions differ significantly
• Effect sizes (Cramér's V) measure practical significance
