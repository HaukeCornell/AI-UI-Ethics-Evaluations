CHI 2025: STATISTICAL EVIDENCE FOR EVALUATION FRAMEWORK EFFECTS
=================================================================

ABSTRACT FINDINGS:
-----------------
Statistical analysis of 1,313 professional explanations reveals
significant differences in reasoning patterns across evaluation
frameworks (UEQ, UEEQ, RAW), providing quantitative evidence that
evaluation tools systematically influence ethical design judgment.

KEY STATISTICAL FINDINGS:
-------------------------
• Responsibility avoidance significantly higher in RAW condition
• Manipulation awareness significantly higher in UEEQ condition
• Industry conformity justifications peak in RAW condition
• Effect sizes indicate medium to large practical significance

METHODOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS:
-----------------------------
• First statistical analysis of evaluation framework effects on reasoning
• Novel pattern detection methodology for professional explanations
• Reproducible pipeline for analyzing design decision justifications
• Benchmark dataset for future HCI ethics research

IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGN PRACTICE:
---------------------------------
• Evaluation frameworks shape moral reasoning, not just measurement
• RAW conditions promote responsibility diffusion
• UEEQ frameworks enhance ethical sensitivity
• Need for framework-aware design education and practice
