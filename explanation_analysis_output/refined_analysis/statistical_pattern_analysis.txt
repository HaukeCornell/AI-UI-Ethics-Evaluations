STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF KEY REASONING PATTERNS
=======================================================

RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
------------------
1. Do evaluation frameworks influence reasoning patterns?
2. Are there statistically significant differences between conditions?
3. What are the effect sizes of these differences?
