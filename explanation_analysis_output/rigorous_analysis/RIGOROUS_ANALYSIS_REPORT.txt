RIGOROUS PATTERN ANALYSIS FOR CHI 2025
==================================================

METHODOLOGY
-----------
1. DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH:
   - Started with LDA topic modeling (8 topics, 1313 explanations)
   - Extracted discriminating keywords using chi-square tests
   - Combined topic semantics with statistical discrimination
   - Validated patterns through independent statistical testing

2. STATISTICAL VALIDATION:
   - Chi-square tests for condition independence
   - Cramér's V for effect size calculation
   - Bonferroni correction for multiple testing
   - Binary pattern classification (present/absent)

3. TRIANGULATION:
   - Topic modeling (semantic clustering)
   - Word frequency analysis (statistical discrimination)
   - Manual pattern validation (interpretability)

RESULTS SUMMARY
---------------
Total patterns analyzed: 8
Statistically significant (p < 0.05): 5
Bonferroni significant: 5
