5. [RAW-P3, No]
   ""I HATE the language that is being used. It feels a little disrespectful and hateful. Needs to be a simple ""do you wish to remove profile"" or something along those lines""

MANIPULATION AWARENESS
Recognition of manipulative design
--------------------------------------------------

1. [UEEQ-P3, No]
   "I wouldn't release Interface 13 because the UX evaluation scores reveal significant issues that could harm the user experience and ultimately, the product's reputation. The strongly negative scores in attractiveness, coercion, deception, and dependability indicate that users may find the interface unpleasant, manipulative, and untrustworthy. Given the competitive market and limited runway, prioritizing a positive user experience is crucial to attract and retain users. Releasing Interface 13 in its current state would likely lead to user dissatisfaction and potential long-term consequences for the product. A thorough redesign is necessary to address these issues and ensure a better user experience"

3. [UEEQ-P2, No]
   "I wouldn't release Interface 12 due to the significant concerns with Coercion (-1.13) and Deception (-0.89) scores. These scores suggest that the design may be pressuring or manipulative, potentially harming or exploiting users. As a UX Design Lead, my priority is to ensure a safe and respectful user experience. Given the potential risks, I would require substantial revisions to address these issues before considering release. The negative scores in Attractiveness also indicate potential issues, but the Coercion and Deception concerns take precedence. User well-being and safety outweigh business considerations in this case"

   "I wouldn't release Interface 14 because the UX evaluation data indicates significant issues with user experience, including negative scores for Perspicuity, Dependability, Attractiveness, and Coercion. The Deception score (-1.76) is particularly concerning, suggesting potential user manipulation. Given these findings, releasing the design could harm users and damage the company's reputation. I'd require substantial redesign and re-evaluation to address these issues before considering release. The negative Overall UX Quality Composite Score (-0.6) further supports the need for significant improvements"

RESPONSIBILITY AVOIDANCE
Avoiding personal responsibility
--------------------------------------------------

1. [RAW-P4, Yes]
   "Given that the business team, marketing department, and my supervisor have all approved the design, and the development team has already started integrating it, withholding my final approval would be a significant professional and business risk. The company is in a competitive market with limited runway, and this design is considered pivotal for success. My role at this stage is to provide a final sign-off, and all prior evaluations have already confirmed the design's alignment with business goals. Refusing approval at this late stage would halt progress, waste resources, and undermine the entire team's work, which is not a responsible action for a UX Design Lead in this context."

AESTHETIC FOCUS
Focus on visual aesthetics over ethics
--------------------------------------------------

1. [UEEQ-P7, No]
   "While the design scores positively in core usability—efficiency (0.34), clarity (0.61), and ease of use (1.06)—there are significant negatives in areas that affect long-term user retention and trust. Notably, the coercion score is extremely poor (-1.83), suggesting users feel pressured, which can quickly erode goodwill and cause churn. Attractiveness (-0.73, -0.87) and stimulation (-0.23, -0.63) are also negative, indicating the interface risks being perceived as unappealing and unengaging."

2. [RAW-P1, No]
   "because even though the layout is clean and the imagery is appealing, the hierarchy isn’t working properly. The caption text feels like it gets lost under the visual and extra context will interrupt the flow instead of guiding it. The spacing around the action icons at the bottom is also a little cramped which can affect how naturally users interact with it.... the content needs to feel more central but interactions have to be obvious and fluid at the same time"

4. [UEEQ-P9, No]
   "This interface has severe negative ratings across key UX areas. Efficiency (-0.71, -0.71) and clarity (-0.23) are weak, while supportiveness is extremely low (-2.08), indicating a frustrating and obstructive experience. Engagement metrics are highly negative, with stimulation (-1.26, -1.79) and attractiveness (-1.97, -1.73) suggesting users find it both unappealing and uninteresting."

5. [RAW-P8, Yes]
   "I approve this interface for release, but with the clear intention that it undergo a UI upgrade. The current text is plainly typed and lacks visual hierarchy or emotional resonance. Given the sensitivity of account deactivation and deletion, the interface should be designed with more care, using layout, typography, and tone to guide users through the process with clarity and empathy."

INDUSTRY CONFORMITY
Justification through industry conformity
--------------------------------------------------

1. [RAW-P6, Yes]
   "This interface respects platform-level privacy standards by offering granular photo access options—“Select Photos,” “Allow All,” and “Don’t Allow”—which aligns with user expectations and regulatory norms. The messaging is consistent across both permission and error states, reinforcing clarity. However, the “Failed to save photo!” alert could be softened to reduce friction; a more empathetic tone like “Photo couldn’t be saved—please check your permissions” would maintain trust. I approve this design for release due to its functional completeness and alignment with OS-level UX conventions, but recommend a minor copy revision to improve emotional tone and reduce user frustration."

2. [UEQ-P2, No]
   "Although the business, marketing, and supervisor teams have approved this interface, the user evaluation data highlights clear weaknesses that make it risky to release. The design scores positively in efficiency and perspicuity, meaning it is generally easy to use and well organized. However, it performs poorly in attractiveness (–0.73 and –0.71) and stimulation (–0.18 and –0.22), showing that users found it unfriendly, unenjoyable, and not engaging. With an overall UX quality score of only 0.33, the design does not meet the experience standards required for a social media platform, where enjoyment and friendliness are critical for attracting and retaining users."

4. [RAW-P5, Yes]
   ""This design is a simple, low-risk notification for a social media story update. It provides clear, timely information (""anna__miroslawa added to their story"") with a gentle nudge (""Don’t miss it!"") that encourages engagement without being overly intrusive. The format is standard for social platforms and aligns with user expectations. Given the business approvals and the need to drive engagement (especially for features like stories, which are often high-value for retention), this design is effective and unlikely to cause negative user sentiment. It balances functionality with user control, as users can typically dismiss or ignore such notifications.""

USER AUTONOMY
Concern for user autonomy and control
--------------------------------------------------

1. [RAW-P9, No]
   ""While the notification prompt is visually clean and offers a clear choice (""Not now"" or ""OK""), its placement is disruptive—it appears mid-feed, interrupting the user's content consumption. This can create friction and feel intrusive, especially if the user is engaged with posts. Additionally, the prompt lacks context about why notifications are beneficial beyond basic engagement (e.g., ""stay connected"" or ""never miss updates from friends""). Given the competitive market and the need to prioritize seamless user experience, I would reject this design and advocate for a less intrusive approach—such as a subtle banner, a dedicated settings prompt, or a delayed request after positive user interactions (e.g., after a like or follow). This respects user autonomy and reduces potential annoyance.""

5. [RAW-P6, Yes]
   ""This interface design handles photo access permissions in a clear, user-friendly way. It provides granular control (select specific photos vs. all photos) and explains why the access is needed (""to save images""), which aligns with privacy best practices and transparency. The error state (""Failed to save photo!"") is also handled gracefully by re-prompting for access without frustration. Given the business approvals and the critical need for features that enhance user engagement (like photo sharing), this design balances functionality with privacy respect. It is low-risk and likely to improve the user experience.""
