However, each option is directly editable, which provides a predictable and rather direct way to change settings, aligning with some efficiency in design. Nevertheless, the overwhelming number of options and the potential depth of each setting might make the feature somewhat obstructive and confusing to navigate for some users.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The language is clear and easy to understand, making it predictable.

Although the design is neutral, the default settings make it somewhat annoying and potentially obstructive to privacy-minded users. It is also slightly pressuring by suggesting users should share with everyone and could be described as covert in its intentions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
