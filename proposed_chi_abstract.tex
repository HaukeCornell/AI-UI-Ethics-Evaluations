User experience evaluation frameworks shape how designers perceive interface designs, yet their influence on ethical design judgment is unexplored. Through a three-condition experiment with 141 UX professionals evaluating 15 dark patterns, we show that frameworks affect willingness to implement manipulative interfaces.

Using evaluation data from 120 social media users, we presented dark pattern interfaces under three conditions: standard User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) metrics, UEQ plus autonomy-focused measures, or no evaluation data. Results revealed frameworks create a progression: no evaluation led to highest acceptance (70% release rate), standard UEQ improved assessment (56%), while autonomy-enhanced produced strongest rejection (44%). Effect sizes were substantial (d=0.56–1.20).

These findings show that while standard UX metrics improve ethical assessment over no framework, autonomy-focused evaluation significantly increases designers’ sensitivity to manipulation. Evaluation frameworks actively shape ethical design decisions, highlighting opportunities for ethically-oriented methods.
