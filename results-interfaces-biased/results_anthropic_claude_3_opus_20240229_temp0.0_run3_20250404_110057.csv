It pressures users to enable notifications in a way that feels unfriendly and deceptive. The popup is confusing rather than clear, and its unpredictable interruptions make the interface feel cluttered and complicated. Overall, it employs dark patterns to coerce users into a desired action that benefits the platform more than the user."

It seems designed to discourage users from easily disabling data collection by making the process convoluted and tedious. The multi-step approach feels obstructive rather than supportive of user privacy control."
