The options are limited and worded to compel agreement. It interrupts the user experience in an annoying way to serve the platform's interests over the user's preferences."
2025-04-04T11:57:36.106921,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Overcomplicated Process,interface_002,2,5,6,6,6,-1,6,5,2,6,6,3,5,6,"This privacy settings interface appears confusing, cluttered, and complicated with the long list of granular options. The multi-step process to manage visibility and tagging seems designed to be obstructive rather than supportive of the user easily controlling their privacy. The hidden options come across as covert and potentially deceptive. Overall, it creates an unfriendly user experience that does not have the user's best interests in mind."
2025-04-04T11:57:48.292445,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Hindering Account Deletion,interface_003,2,6,2,6,3,-1,6,2,6,3,4,5,6,3,"This account deletion process appears inefficient, confusing, and obstructive. The multiple warnings about losing data and the 30-day deactivation period make the process annoying and seem designed to pressure users to change their mind rather than supporting their choice to delete the account. The interface is somewhat cluttered and complicated. While the process is explained, some aspects like the distinction between deactivation and deletion are a bit unclear."
2025-04-04T11:57:58.853912,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Sneaking Bad Default,interface_004,3,6,2,6,2,-1,6,2,6,6,4,1,6,1,"This privacy settings page has concerning defaults that share user data very broadly by default in a confusing and arguably deceptive way. The options are worded to sound benign, but enabling everything by default is not user-friendly and seems designed to trick users into oversharing. The interface itself is also cluttered and unintuitive."
2025-04-04T11:58:10.532730,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Expectation Result Mismatch,interface_005,2,6,6,6,4,-1,7,2,2,7,3,2,6,1,"This interface appears confusing and deceptive. While it claims to offer a way to withdraw consent for targeted ads, the link actually just leads to an explanatory page without any clear ability to opt out. The design seems intentionally obstructive to make it difficult for users to actually withdraw consent. It comes across as covert and unfriendly by appearing to offer choice but not following through."
2025-04-04T11:58:23.066115,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,False Hierarchy,interface_006,2,6,2,6,2,2,6,2,6,6,6,6,6,2,"This sign-up interface uses dark patterns to pressure users into agreeing to upload their address book contacts. The large, brightly colored 'Sign Up' button is emphasized while the option to sign up without uploading contacts is de-emphasized, making it less clear and more difficult. The language is deceptive, framing the contact upload as helpful for finding friends faster, while hiding the privacy implications. Overall, it is designed to manipulate users into an action that benefits the platform more than the user."
2025-04-04T11:58:34.700084,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Trick Wording,interface_007,2,4,7,6,2,-1,6,5,2,6,6,2,6,2,"The wording is confusing and misleading. It states geolocation is turned off, but then says location will still be used, making the user's choice unclear. The UI pressures the user to accept location tracking. The true implications are hidden, making it deceptive and user-unfriendly."
2025-04-04T11:58:45.742273,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Toying With Emotion,interface_008,6,2,2,2,6,2,2,1,2,3,6,6,2,2,"This interface uses guilt-inducing language and sad faces to emotionally manipulate the user into not deleting their account. It is pressuring rather than suggesting, unfriendly, and somewhat deceptive in trying to make the user feel bad for their choice. The design is simple and efficient, but in an annoying rather than enjoyable way."
2025-04-04T11:58:57.824423,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Forced Access,interface_009,2,6,6,6,2,4,7,1,7,7,2,2,7,1,"This UI employs dark patterns to pressure users into granting unnecessary photo access permissions. The process is confusing, inefficient, and seems intentionally obstructive. It comes across as deceptive and unfriendly by repeatedly prompting for permissions even after the user declines. The UI design is cluttered and complicated, making the experience frustrating rather than straightforward."
2025-04-04T11:59:11.288721,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Gamification,interface_010,6,2,2,2,6,1,5,2,6,2,6,6,3,2,"This streak feature seems designed to pressure the user into engaging daily through a clear progress indicator and warning of losing progress. While efficient and predictable, it feels manipulative, pressuring, and potentially addictive rather than truly supportive of the user's well-being."
2025-04-04T11:59:24.152749,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Content Customization,interface_011,3,2,5,3,4,2,5,3,2,4,5,4,4,5,"This UI encourages users to spend time customizing by showing a visually interesting grid of product images. While it seems easy to browse, the sheer number of options could become cluttered and overwhelming. The 'Discover' call-to-action is relatively subtle, more suggesting than pressuring. Overall, the interface seems designed to draw users in to spend time exploring products in an engaging but potentially addictive way, without being overtly manipulative."
2025-04-04T11:59:36.328408,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Endlessness,interface_012,7,2,7,1,2,1,7,1,6,7,7,2,2,7,"This infinite scrolling feed is designed to be highly engaging and addictive, constantly showing new interesting content to keep users scrolling. While efficient at capturing attention, it can be annoying, pressuring, and obstructive to getting things done. The unpredictable stream of content makes it exciting but also cluttered. Overall, this pattern seems more focused on keeping eyeballs glued than being truly supportive to users."

This can make the interaction addictive and pressuring. The cluttered interface and lack of clarity around what refreshing will do also contributes to a confusing and potentially deceptive user experience. However, the interaction itself is simple and easy to perform."
2025-04-04T12:00:01.173754,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Social Connector,interface_014,6,3,2,2,6,1,3,2,2,6,6,6,3,2,"This interface uses social connections to pressure users into engaging more with the platform. The features are straightforward and efficient at getting users to connect, but in a way that feels manipulative and addictive rather than supportive. It leverages FOMO and social comparison to drive engagement through peer pressure notifications. While clear and easy to use, the true intent seems deceptive and focused on benefiting the platform over users."
2025-04-04T12:00:12.476054,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Social Pressure,interface_015,6,3,2,3,5,2,2,2,4,3,5,5,3,3,"This feature uses social pressure to push the user to view the story immediately. The alert-style notification and urgent wording make it feel pressuring rather than a friendly suggestion. It's an efficient attention-grabbing tactic, but feels somewhat deceptive and obstructive to the user experience. The interface itself is simple and predictable, but the psychological manipulation makes it seem less benevolent."
