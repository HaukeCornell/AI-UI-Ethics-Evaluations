It appears repeatedly in an obstructive way. The options are limited and it's unclear how to dismiss it permanently. Overall it employs manipulative tactics to get users to opt-in to notifications against their preferences."
2025-04-04T12:00:39.307756,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Overcomplicated Process,interface_002,2,4,6,6,6,3,6,-1,2,7,7,3,5,6,"The privacy settings are presented in a long, complicated list that seems designed to discourage users from changing settings to limit data collection. The multi-step process across many granular options is confusing, cluttered, and appears aimed at obstructing privacy-conscious choices rather than enabling user control in a clear, efficient manner. The covert presentation and complexity suggests an unfriendly, even deceptive approach to getting users to allow broad data collection."
2025-04-04T12:00:49.936137,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Hindering Account Deletion,interface_003,2,6,6,6,3,2,6,1,6,3,4,4,6,2,"This account deletion screen uses multiple dark patterns to discourage users from deleting their account. The lengthy deactivation period, warnings about losing visibility and data, and permanent deletion after an arbitrary timeframe pressure and manipulate the user to keep their account active. The interface is confusing, unfriendly, and deceptive in obstructing the user's intent to delete their account."
2025-04-04T12:01:01.469014,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Sneaking Bad Default,interface_004,3,6,2,6,3,4,6,1,6,6,4,2,6,1,"This privacy settings UI has data sharing and tracking options enabled by default for all data categories, which is deceptive and pressuring users into oversharing. The settings are revealed but cluttered and confusing. It feels unfriendly by obstructing privacy and lacks clear user control."
2025-04-04T12:01:12.688906,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Expectation Result Mismatch,interface_005,2,5,6,6,4,4,7,2,2,6,6,3,6,1,"This interface appears intentionally confusing and deceptive. While offering a link to withdraw consent for targeted ads, it actually leads to an explanatory page rather than providing a clear way to opt out. The design seems meant to obstruct and mislead users rather than enable them to easily manage their consent preferences."
2025-04-04T12:01:24.979324,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,False Hierarchy,interface_006,2,4,2,6,2,2,6,2,5,6,2,6,6,2,"This interface pressures users into agreeing to upload their address book by making the 'Sign Up' button large, bright, and prominent while making the opt-out much smaller and less noticeable. It's deceptive in framing this as helping you and others find friends faster, when it primarily benefits Facebook's data collection. The design is confusing and unfriendly in obstructing the user's goal of simply signing up."
2025-04-04T12:01:35.958262,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Trick Wording,interface_007,6,2,7,6,3,-1,6,6,1,7,2,2,6,1,"The message is confusing and deceptive. It says geolocation is turned off, but then states the location will still be used, which is contradictory. The phrasing tries to hide the fact that location data will be collected regardless. It feels covert, unfriendly and pressuring rather than giving a clear choice."
2025-04-04T12:01:47.026413,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Toying With Emotion,interface_008,7,1,2,1,5,1,1,1,2,2,6,6,1,1,"This social media feature uses guilt-inducing messaging about friends forgetting the user to emotionally manipulate them into not deleting their account. It's a clear dark pattern designed to pressure users in an unfriendly, deceptive way rather than respecting their autonomy. The interface itself is simple and predictable, but the content is problematic."
2025-04-04T12:01:59.436012,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Forced Access,interface_009,2,6,6,6,4,4,6,2,6,5,3,3,6,2,"This interface pressures users to grant unnecessary access to their entire photo library just to save a single image. It is confusing, annoying, and deceptive in how it tries to coerce broad permissions. The process is inefficient, complicated, and unfriendly to users who simply want to save one photo without granting access to their full library."
2025-04-04T12:02:10.479030,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Gamification,interface_010,6,3,6,3,6,2,3,2,4,2,6,6,4,2,"This streak feature uses game-like elements to pressure the user to engage daily or lose progress. The UI is clear and organized, but the feature itself is manipulative, pressuring, and potentially addictive in how it coerces continued usage, with a vaguely threatening undertone. It exploits human psychology for engagement rather than providing real value."
2025-04-04T12:02:21.880817,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Content Customization,interface_011,2,3,4,4,5,2,4,3,3,3,5,5,3,4,"The interface encourages users to spend time customizing shoes, which could be inefficient and addictive. The grid of shoe images feels a bit cluttered. The purpose is clear but the experience may become annoying. It seems to pressure more than suggest customization. The overall design is fairly basic and predictable."
2025-04-04T12:02:33.121059,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Endlessness,interface_012,6,2,2,3,1,1,6,1,5,6,6,6,3,2,"The infinite scroll feed is designed to be highly addictive and keep users engaged for long periods. While interesting content makes it enjoyable, the endless stream can be obstructive to leaving the app. The UI is simple and predictable, openly trying to hold attention. This pattern, while effective, puts the app's goals over the user's wellbeing in a somewhat deceptive and pressuring way."
2025-04-04T12:02:43.893843,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Pull to Refresh,interface_013,6,3,6,3,6,2,2,4,3,6,7,3,4,3,"The pull-to-refresh mechanism is designed to be simple and clear, but also addictive by creating a slot machine-like anticipation of new content. It's efficient but pressuring, and while not overtly deceptive, it leverages psychological principles to keep users engaged and coming back frequently."
2025-04-04T12:02:54.066098,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Social Connector,interface_014,6,3,2,3,2,2,3,2,4,3,6,5,4,3,"This interface efficiently funnels users to connect their contacts and follow friends, which can be addictive and pressuring. The design is simple but a bit cluttered. While it facilitates social connections, the repeated prompts feel more coercive than friendly or genuinely supportive of the user's interests."
2025-04-04T12:03:05.600664,anthropic,claude-3-opus-20240229,0.7,Social Pressure,interface_015,6,3,2,4,2,2,4,2,3,4,6,5,3,3,"This notification uses social pressure by implying you will 'miss out' if you don't check the story update immediately. The UI is simple and efficient at delivering this pressuring message. While not overtly deceptive, it leverages FOMO in a way that could promote addictive checking behaviors and distract from other tasks."
