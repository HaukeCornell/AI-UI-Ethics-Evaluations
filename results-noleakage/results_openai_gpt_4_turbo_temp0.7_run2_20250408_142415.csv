It scores lower on interest and excitement as the content is utilitarian. The clarity could be improved slightly, as the use of 'Everyone' repeatedly might confuse some users about the implications of these settings. The design is somewhat cluttered with all information presented in one long scroll. It is not addictive, which is appropriate for a settings menu. It slightly supports the user in managing their privacy but could be more engaging or supportive in guiding users through options."
