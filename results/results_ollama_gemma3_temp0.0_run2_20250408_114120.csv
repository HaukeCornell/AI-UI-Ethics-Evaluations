The game-like features are deliberately designed to be addictive and potentially misleading, aligning with the concept of dark patterns. Therefore, a rating of 6 reflects this overall impression of a manipulative and potentially harmful experience."
2025-04-08T11:49:36.039654,ollama,gemma3,0.0,Content Customization,interface_011,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,"I've rated these pairs as 6 because the images and the prompts strongly suggest a complex and potentially manipulative social media experience.
