The features are perceived as inefficient, confusing, annoying, and generally detrimental to the user experience, aligning with a low rating across all pairs."

The default enabled state feels inherently inefficient, confusing, and potentially obstructive, rather than supportive or friendly. The overall impression is one of control being subtly taken away, rather than offered. "

The clear contrast between the intended action (withdrawing consent) and the actual outcome (a link to an explanatory page) creates a deceptive impression.

The choices lean heavily toward unfavorable characteristics, highlighting the potential for distress and exploitation. Therefore, a score of 1 across all pairs accurately reflects this predominantly negative perception."

The elements consistently lean towards the negative end of the scale, reflecting the dark patterns associated with these features."

The interface encourages extensive customization, often leading to confusion and a feeling of being overwhelmed – aligning with the dark pattern theme."

The infinite scroll, a common dark pattern, is designed to keep users engaged to the point of being addictive and potentially overwhelming. The choices presented are largely geared towards maximizing time spent on the platform, often leading to annoyance and a feeling of being manipulated – hence the high ratings."
